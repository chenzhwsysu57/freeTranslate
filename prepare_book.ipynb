Over the past few decades, under the leadership and support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health, several generations of Chinese academicians represented by Biao Fazu, Wu Jieping, Wu Mengchao, Chen Yuzhu and other academicians have high moral character, rich clinical and teaching experience, a high sense of responsibility and professionalism. Famous academicians, experts, medical scientists and educators at home and abroad participated in the creation of this set of textbooks and each round of textbook revision, which made the five-year undergraduate clinical medicine textbooks in my country develop from nothing to something, from few to many, and from From more to fine, we have continuously enriched, improved and innovated, forming a three-dimensional teaching material consisting of planning teaching materials, supporting teaching materials, supporting CDs, digital publishing, and network value-added services with complete course categories, optimized subject system, reasonable content connection, and scientific structure system. pattern. This set of textbooks has provided a fundamental guarantee for the training and development of millions of medical students in my country, and has trained generations of high-level and high-quality qualified medical talents for my country, making a historic contribution to promoting the reform and development of my country's medical and health care industry. It has made great contributions to the development of higher medical undergraduate education in my country, and promoted the construction of textbooks and education development in related disciplines or fields of medicine in my country through innovative construction and high-quality development of textbooks, and has blazed a trail suitable for Chinese medicine. The development of education and health care has created a path for the construction and development of medical textbooks with Chinese characteristics, and a model for the construction of medical education textbooks with Chinese characteristics. The older generation of medical educators and scientists affectionately called this set of textbooks the \"Chinese Medical Education\" The eighth round of revision of this set of textbooks was launched at a time when the world is reflecting on a century of medical education, and when my country's medical and health system reform and medical education reform are advancing in all directions. They jointly held a national medical education reform work conference and launched a comprehensive reform of clinical medical education with \"$5+3$\" as the main body, forming a historical development pattern in which medical reform promotes education reform, and education reform serves medical reform. The People's Medical Publishing House and the National Higher Medical Textbook Construction Research Association have seized the historical development opportunity of the comprehensive reform of medical education and taken the opportunity of the full launch of the eighth round of planned textbooks for the five-year undergraduate clinical medicine major in colleges and universities across the country to plan textbooks. Innovative construction, comprehensively promote the construction of national-level planned textbooks, and serve the medical and educational reforms. The principles of the eighth round of textbook revisions are to actively implement the opinions of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health on implementing comprehensive reforms in clinical medical education, strive to optimize the talent training structure, Adhere to the demand-oriented approach, build and develop a clinical medical talent training system with the \"$5+3$\" model as the main body; reform the curriculum system, teaching content, teaching methods and evaluation and assessment methods; integrate medical ethics education into the entire process of medical education, Strengthen clinical practice teaching, take a variety of measures, and effectively implement the requirements of \"early clinical practice, more clinical practice, and repeated clinical practice\" to improve students' clinical practice ability. Inspired by the spirit of the national comprehensive reform of medical education and the dedication of the older generation of medical scientists, a large number of young and middle-aged experts, scholars and professors in the front line of clinical teaching, scientific research and medical treatment have inherited and carried forward the spirit of the older generation. Excellent tradition, with a rigorous scientific attitude and selfless dedication, actively participated in the revision and construction of the eighth round of textbooks, closely combined with the five-year clinical medicine professional training goals, the needs of higher medical education and teaching reform and the medical and health industry In order to meet the demand for talents, we have drawn on the experience and achievements of medical education and teaching at home and abroad, continuously innovated the writing ideas and editing models, continuously improved the expression form and content, and continuously improved the writing level and quality, and gradually made each textbook a high-quality subject. The eighth round of textbooks has been made more mature, complete and scientific, thus building a textbook system that is suitable for the comprehensive reform of medical education with \"$5+3$\" as the main body and the needs of cultivating excellent clinical physicians, and promoting the five majors that are suitable for China's national conditions. Construction of a curriculum system for the 2-year undergraduate program in biomedical engineering\n",
      "{The features of this revision and editing are as follows:} begin{enumerate} item The editing and revision of the textbooks was carried out under the leadership and support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health, in accordance with the timetable, roadmap and construction drawings of the comprehensive reform of clinical medical education with \"$5+3$\" as the main body, and was planned by the National Higher Medical Textbook Construction Research Association, approved by the National Clinical Medicine Professional Textbook Review Committee, checked by academicians and experts, and edited by well-known experts and professors from medical schools across the country, and published by the People's Medical Publishing House with high quality. item The editing and revision of the textbooks was carried out scientifically based on the training objectives of the Ministry of Education, the industry requirements of the Ministry of Health, and the employment needs of society, and on the basis of scientific research across the country, drawing on the medical talent training model and textbook construction experience at home and abroad, and fully studying and demonstrating the quality requirements of talents in this major, the composition of the discipline system, the design of the curriculum system and the planning of the textbook system. item Based on extensive and in-depth research across the country, it summarized and absorbed the experience and achievements of the previous seven rounds of textbook editing, especially made a lot of revisions and improvements to some shortcomings, and on the basis of fully reflecting scientificity and authority, it also considered its representativeness and applicability across the country. The revision of item textbooks focuses on optimizing and reforming the curriculum system and promoting the innovation of the textbook system. It integrates the curriculum scientifically, de-emphasizes the subject consciousness, realizes overall optimization, focuses on system science, and ensures the combination of points and surfaces. It continues to adhere to the textbook compilation principles of \"three basics, five characteristics, and three specifics\" to ensure the quality of textbooks. In order to meet the needs of teaching reform, reduce the burden on students, and reflect the characteristics of \"stem cell\" textbooks, item has refined the text and compressed the number of words in the whole set of textbooks, focusing on improving the quality of content. According to the needs of the subject, it adopts large 16-mo international format, two-color or color printing to improve the printing quality and readability. At the same time, blank space is added on each page to facilitate students to record and mark the key knowledge in the book. In order to meet the diversified needs of teaching resources, item has realized the serialization, three-dimensionalization and digitalization of textbooks. Most textbooks are equipped with supporting textbooks and digitally published teaching materials, and the network value-added service of the whole set of textbooks has been realized, which is convenient for teachers to teach and students to learn independently, and realizes the sharing of digital resources. end{enumerate} There are 53 textbooks in the eighth round, of which 2 are newly added, namely \"Doctor-Patient Communication\" and \"Introduction to Oncology\"; 1 is renamed, namely \"Emergency Medicine\" is renamed \"Emergency and Disaster Medicine\"; 2 are merged, namely \"Biochemistry\" and \"Medical Molecular Biology\" are merged into \"Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\". All the textbooks are the national planning textbooks for undergraduates of general higher education in the \"Twelfth Five-Year Plan\" (except \"Introduction to Oncology\") and the \"Twelfth Five-Year Plan\" textbooks of the Ministry of Health. They were all published and distributed in June 2013. This set of textbooks was organized and compiled under the background of comprehensive reform of medical education in my country and the construction of a clinical medical talent training system with \"$5+3$\" as the main body. It is hoped that all colleges and universities across the country can provide more valuable opinions and feedback on the use of information during the use process, so as to gradually modify and improve the content of the textbooks, improve the quality of the textbooks, and provide suggestions for the revision of the ninth round of textbooks. {The eighth round of the national five-year undergraduate clinical medicine program in colleges and universities} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-006} end{center} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-007} end{center} {The sixth round of the national five-year undergraduate clinical medicine program in colleges and universities} Consultants Shen Xiaoming Wang Debing Liu Depei Wu Mengchao Liu Yunyi Chairperson Chen Haozhu Zhong Nanshan Vice Chairperson Wang Weiping Yang Baofeng Gong Feili Ke Yang Shi Yingkang Zheng Shusen Members (in order of the number of strokes of the surname) Wang Bin Wang Guanjun Wang Jialiang Wang Hongli Wen Liyang Wen Mingang Wen Jifang Kong Beihua High-level and high-quality medical education is not only an important part of running a satisfactory education for the people, but also an important support for the reform and development of medical and health care. With the deepening of the reform of China's medical and health system, higher requirements have been put forward for the reform of higher medical education. How to cultivate high-quality and high-level medical talents that meet the needs of the country and satisfy the people is the primary task of current medical education. To this end, in the first year of the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health jointly organized and implemented the comprehensive reform of medical education. The comprehensive reform of medical education requires us to thoroughly implement the Outline of the Education Plan and the opinions on the reform of the medical and health system, follow the laws of medical education, take reform and innovation as the driving force, focus on the close integration of the development of medical education and the development of the medical and health industry, focus on key breakthroughs in talent training models, systems and mechanisms, focus on the significant improvement of medical students' professional ethics and clinical practice ability, and focus on the significant strengthening of the medical education quality assurance system, so as to comprehensively improve the quality of medical talent training and provide a solid talent guarantee for the development of the medical and health industry and the improvement of people's health. Textbook construction plays an important basic role in improving the quality of talent training. The Ministry of Education has always attached great importance to this and requires that the reform of medical courses and teaching methods be promoted with textbook construction as the starting point. A good textbook gives medical students the right guidance and gives clinical doctors the right guidance. As a national excellent publishing unit, the People's Medical Publishing House has undertaken a large number of textbook planning and publishing work, forming a textbook publishing model with a complete range of courses, a reasonable subject system and comprehensive supporting services. Especially under the efforts and leadership of the older generation of medical experts represented by academicians such as Wu Jieping, Pei Fazu, Wu Mengchao, and Chen Zhuzhu, and with the efforts and participation of a large number of medical education elites, the five-year undergraduate clinical medicine professional planning textbooks published by them have cultivated generations of outstanding medical talents for my country's academic community and made great historical contributions to promoting the reform and development of my country's medical and health care. The revision of the eighth round of five-year undergraduate clinical medicine professional planning textbooks was initiated on the basis of implementing the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on \"deepening comprehensive reform in the field of education\" and the implementation of the \"Several Opinions on Implementing Comprehensive Reform of Clinical Medical Education\" jointly issued by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. The revision work runs through the requirements of comprehensive reform of medical education, especially focusing on integrating medical ethics education throughout the entire process of medical education, adding the book \"Doctor-Patient Communication\", and strengthening clinical practice teaching. Related practical guidance has been compiled to improve the clinical practice ability of medical students. We believe that with the concerted efforts of the education and health systems, and with the strong support and participation of the majority of medical educators, the revision and publication of the eighth round of five-year undergraduate clinical medicine professional planning textbooks will play a positive role in promoting the comprehensive reform of medical education and improving the quality of medical talent training.

It has gradually formed with the development of modern sciences such as clinical medicine (especially surgery), basic medicine and medical bioengineering, and has also promoted the progress and development of clinical disciplines. Surgical pain was once one of the important factors hindering the development of surgery. In 1846, Morton successfully demonstrated ether anesthesia at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the United States, laying the foundation for the development of surgery. However, the impact of surgery on the body is not only pain, but also causes changes in various physiological functions; although anesthesia can solve the problem of surgical pain, it can also affect physiological functions and even endanger life. Painless surgery is achieved at a physiological cost. Therefore, how to maintain and regulate the patient's physiological function during surgical anesthesia is not only an important part of anesthesiology, but also more difficult and complex than simply eliminating surgical pain in terms of difficulty, depth and breadth of knowledge required. In the perioperative period, anesthesiologists use various monitoring technologies most frequently, are most familiar with airway control and respiratory management, and have the most opportunities to use large amounts of rapid intraoperative infusion and blood transfusion, and various vasoactive drugs. Therefore, the anesthesia theory and technology gradually formed in clinical practice, including disease assessment, airway management, organ function monitoring, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and pain treatment, have been widely used in diagnosis and treatment outside the operating room, and have derived critical care medicine and pain diagnosis and treatment departments. For clinical medical students, no matter what profession they will be engaged in in the future, they can apply the basic theories and techniques of anesthesiology to analyze and deal with clinical problems, especially the monitoring, condition judgment and treatment of critically ill patients. Therefore, learning anesthesiology well can not only broaden clinical thinking, but also enhance the ability to discover, analyze and solve problems in clinical work. According to the needs of the knowledge structure of medical students today, in the process of compiling this textbook, we strive to introduce the methods and implementation of clinical anesthesia from a macro level, and make a deep and easy-to-understand introduction from theory to practice to the core theories and techniques of anesthesiology, including the monitoring and regulation of perioperative vital functions, the maintenance and treatment of important organ functions, and pain diagnosis and treatment, so as to meet the needs of modern medical education. In the compilation of this textbook, the opinions and suggestions of many senior medical experts and well-known anesthesiology experts were listened to. Professor Zeng Yinming made systematic suggestions on the content, depth and quality control of the textbook compilation. In the compilation process, we received the understanding, support and selfless dedication of all editors. I would like to express my sincere gratitude. However, to become a mature and excellent textbook, it still needs continuous summarization, improvement and perfection. I believe that with the joint efforts of colleagues in the national anesthesia field, \"Anesthesiology\" will become better and better in the process of inheritance. {Yang Baxian Li Wenzhi} February 2013 Section 1 Overview 1 Section 2 The development of anesthesiology 1 Section 3 The organizational structure and connotation of the anesthesiology department 3 I.

Driven by the development of social and medical sciences, as well as the cross-disciplinary, infiltration and support, the goals and connotations pursued by anesthesiologists have also kept pace with the times. Therefore, the task of anesthesiologists today is not only to provide sedation, painlessness, muscle relaxation and reasonable stress control for the smooth progress of surgery, but also to monitor, regulate and control the vital functions of patients during the perioperative period, maintain the functions of important organs, and ensure the smooth recovery of patients after surgery. The work of the Department of Anesthesiology has expanded from the operating room to outside the operating room, including outpatient clinics and wards; its time span has also extended to the perioperative period, including preoperative and postoperative work in addition to intraoperative work; its connotation includes all areas related to patient safety and quality of life; it not only has professional techniques, but also systematic professional theories. Therefore, modern anesthesiology has become a science that studies clinical anesthesia, vital function monitoring, critical care monitoring and treatment, and pain diagnosis and treatment. Although pain science and critical care medicine have developed into a new profession, both professions have obvious multidisciplinary characteristics, and their connection with anesthesiology is long-standing and difficult to separate. Therefore, pain diagnosis and treatment and perioperative critical care monitoring and treatment are not only the responsibilities of the Department of Anesthesiology, but also an important part of anesthesiology. {Section 2 Development of Anesthesiology} With the continuous development of society and the progress of social civilization, improving the quality of life is an eternal theme of human life activities, and pain and its control have naturally become one of its important contents. Although the exploration of pain control and anesthesia implementation can be traced back to thousands of years ago (Figure 1-1), the evolution from the pursuit of painlessness or analgesia (analgesia) to anesthesia (anesthetic technique), and then to clinical anesthesia (clinical anesthesia) and anesthesiology (anesthesiology) is a modern development. The development of modern anesthesiology began in the 1840s. In October 1846, Morton performed a successful surgical operation under ether anesthesia at the Massachusetts General Hospital of Harvard University begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-026} end{center} Figure 1-1 Hua Tuo (200 AD), the founder of anesthesia in my country, demonstrated the success of surgical operation under ether anesthesia (Figure 1-2), which opened the prelude of modern anesthesia. The word \"anesthesia\" originated from the suggestion given by Oliver Wendell Holmes to Morton in November 1846. In Greek, an means \"nothing\" and esthesia means \"perception\". Although modern anesthesia has only experienced a history of more than 170 years, it has developed rapidly due to the development of society, human needs and the development of medical science. Looking back at the development history of more than 170 years, the development of modern anesthesiology can be divided into three important stages that are interconnected and have their own characteristics. {(i) Anesthetic technique} This is the first stage of the development of modern anesthesiology, which has a long time span. It has experienced a development process of nearly 100 years since the 1840s. It is the starting stage of anesthesiology. In this stage of development, the main task of anesthesiologists is to solve the pain caused by surgical trauma, that is, to achieve painlessness. In order to effectively control pain, the pioneers of anesthesia work are committed to the development, innovation and clinical application of drugs and begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-027} end{center} Figure 1-2 The scene of the successful demonstration of ether anesthesia on October 16, 1846 (or) anesthesia methods. Following inhalation anesthesia, local anesthesia and nerve block anesthesia were also applied successively, such as Carl Koller using cocaine eye drops for surface anesthesia in 1884, William Halsted for skin nerve conduction block; August Bier used cocaine for subarachnoid block anesthesia in 1898; G. Hirschel used $2%$ procaine for brachial plexus block in 1911; Fidel Pages used procaine for epidural block in 1921. In the field of general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation was successfully applied to clinical anesthesia (William Macewen, 1878), portable laryngoscope, closed anesthesia machine and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ absorption tank (Ralph Waters, 1923) came out one after another. Anesthesia quickly became popular around the world, promoting the development of surgery and even the entire medicine. But the main responsibility of anesthesiologists at that time was to master and use these techniques. Therefore, anesthesiology has obvious characteristics of a medical and technical department. However, this development stage is very important because it laid the methodological foundation of modern anesthesia. To this day, clinical anesthesia methodology still has three important connotations: local anesthesia (including surface anesthesia), block anesthesia (including nerve block, plexus block and spinal block) and general anesthesia. At the same time, the development and clinical application of anesthesia technology urgently require anesthesia workers to solve many corresponding theoretical problems and clinical practical problems, such as anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and the prevention and treatment of complications. Therefore, the theoretical content of anesthesia has been accumulated and enriched. The development of anesthesia theory not only guides clinical practice, but also serves as an important foundation for the continuous development of the discipline. {(II) Clinical anesthesia} The second stage of the development of anesthesia is relatively short, from the early 1930s to the late 1950s. Its characteristics are: (1) Due to the accumulation of theories and technologies in the first stage, anesthesiology has initially acquired its own technical and theoretical characteristics; (2) Due to the professionalism of anesthesia technology and the need to ensure patient safety, anesthesia workers are no longer part-time but full-time, and must undergo special training, forming a professional anesthesia team; (3) While performing anesthesia operations, anesthesiologists must also monitor and deal with various complications caused by surgical trauma, blood loss, coexisting diseases and anesthesia itself in the early stage. Clinical diagnosis and treatment is an important sign of the development of anesthesia from a medical and technical department to a clinical department. Clinical anesthesia has six major components, namely: (1) preoperative examination, evaluation and preparation of patients; (2) implementation and management of anesthesia; (3) anesthesia of specialized patients; (4) anesthesia of critically ill and difficult patients; (5) monitoring during anesthesia; and (6) prevention and treatment of anesthesia complications. It is not difficult to find that during this period, anesthesiology has rapidly developed from medical technology to clinical diagnosis and treatment. The work scope of anesthesiologists has expanded from intraoperative to perioperative period, including preoperative and postoperative period. In addition to providing sedation, painlessness, muscle relaxation, no unpleasant memories, reasonable stress control and other necessary conditions for the smooth progress of surgery, clinical anesthesia must also ensure the safety of patients during surgery, reduce complications and promote smooth recovery of patients after surgery. Anesthesiology has obvious clinical diagnosis and treatment characteristics, so it naturally becomes an important part of clinical medicine, that is, an important branch of surgery. During this development stage, anesthesiology has attracted worldwide attention for its outstanding achievements in promoting the development of surgery, such as the clinical application of muscle relaxants (dextrorotatory tubocurarine, Harold R. Griffith and Enid Johnson, 1942); endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation enable thoracic surgery to open the chest control zone; bronchial anesthesia technology (Carlens and Bjork, 1950) ensures the safety of patients with \"wet lung\"; the application of hypothermia anesthesia (Bigelow, 1950) lays the foundation for blocking circulation and opening the heart forbidden zone for open heart surgery. In addition, controlled hypotension and \"artificial hibernation\" have also been applied in clinical practice. With the support of anesthesiology, various surgical specialties such as brain surgery, cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, pediatric surgery and other specialized surgeries, as well as surgical treatment of critically ill and difficult patients, have developed rapidly. In order to ensure the safety of patients during the anesthesia recovery period, the post-anesthesia recovery room (RR) was officially established in 1951. Therefore, clinical anesthesia is an important development stage for anesthesiology to become perfect and mature. {(III) Anesthesiology} From the late 1950s to the present, anesthesiology has experienced another important leap. Its characteristics are that after more than 170 years of development, especially after 40 years of development since the late 1950s, anesthesiology has continuously absorbed the theories and technologies related to anesthesiology in basic medicine, clinical medicine, biomedical engineering and various marginal disciplines through long-term practice and development in its own development, and has formed its own theoretical and technical system of anesthesiology, thus becoming an important secondary discipline in clinical medicine. Since the 1950s, hospitals in developed countries have proposed a new concept of \"graded treatment\" for the management of patients, that is, centralized management of critically ill patients and patients undergoing major operations, and provided them with sophisticated equipment and excellent medical care conditions, with the aim of improving the success rate of rescue of critically ill patients. Based on the successful experience of establishing the postanesthesia recovery room, the first intensive care unit (ICU) of the Department of Anesthesiology was established in the United States in 1958, thus expanding the work scope of the Department of Anesthesiology from the operating room to the ward and intensive care and treatment. Not only has the work scope expanded from the operating room to the outpatient clinic and ward, but the focus of clinical anesthesia has also shifted to the monitoring, regulation and control of patients' vital functions. The establishment and management of the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and the ICU of the Department of Anesthesiology developed from RR have become an important symbol of hospital modernization, and have provided a strong guarantee for the safety of major surgeries and critically ill patients. The development of pain diagnosis and treatment has opened up a new way for the theory and technology of anesthesiology to serve pain patients, and the imprint of anesthesiology is moving towards every department and corner of the hospital. Therefore, clinical anesthesia, intensive care monitoring and treatment, and pain diagnosis and treatment (pain clinic) have become three important branches of anesthesiology (tertiary disciplines), and the regulation of perioperative vital functions is the essence of anesthesiology (Figure 1-3). In addition, the work of emergency centers, drug dependence and withdrawal (\"detoxification\"), and respiratory therapy are increasingly dependent on the participation of anesthesiologists and are becoming an important part of anesthesiology. Because of this, the name \"anesthesiology\" is increasingly unable to reflect the true connotation of anesthesiology work. Therefore, some countries in the world have revised the name of anesthesiology, such as begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-028} end{center} Figure 1-3 The three important branches of anesthesiology have been renamed as the department of anesthesiology and resuscitation, the department of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and the department of anesthesia and perioperative medicine. In order to highlight the breakthrough progress of anesthesiology today, many publications have named anesthesiology modern anesthesiology. my country's Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health have respectively classified anesthesiology as clinical medicine (first-level discipline) in the medical category, and clearly stated that it is a second-level discipline on par with internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, etc., and is a first-level clinical diagnosis and treatment department in the hospital. At present, the construction and development of anesthesia discipline in my country is rapidly moving towards the platform of secondary clinical discipline.\n",
      "{Section 3 Organizational Structure and Contents of the Department of Anesthesiology} Anesthesiology is an important secondary discipline in clinical medicine. The Department of Anesthesiology is a pivotal primary diagnosis and treatment department in the hospital. The director of the Department of Anesthesiology works under the leadership of the dean. The work tasks of the Department of Anesthesiology include clinical medical treatment, education and scientific research. An anesthesiology department that meets the connotation of a secondary discipline should consist of anesthesiology outpatient clinic, clinical anesthesia (including PACU), ICU, pain diagnosis and treatment, and laboratory departments. Although the construction of anesthesiology departments should vary according to the scale of the hospital and the tasks it undertakes, hospitals at all levels should strive to improve and enhance them according to the connotation of secondary disciplines. {I. Clinical medical work} {(I) Anesthesiology outpatient clinic} With the progress of hospital management work, especially in ensuring quality, improving efficiency and reducing the burden on patients, anesthesia outpatient clinics (or pre-anesthesia assessment centers) will increasingly become an important part of hospital outpatient work. The main work contents of the outpatient department of anesthesiology are as follows: begin{enumerate} item Pre-anesthesia examination, evaluation and preparation In order to shorten the patient's hospitalization period (bed turnover rate) and ensure adequate preparation before anesthesia, all patients who are scheduled to undergo elective surgery should be further examined and prepared by the anesthesiologist in the outpatient department of anesthesiology before admission to the hospital, based on the preoperative examination and preparation by the surgeon. Its advantages are: (1) The surgery can be arranged after the patient is admitted to the hospital, or even on the same day, which can significantly shorten the hospitalization period and improve the bed turnover rate; (2) It can avoid delays in surgery due to incomplete pre-anesthesia examination; (3) It can prevent conflicts between surgeons and anesthesiologists due to disagreements on preoperative preparation; (4) Before the patient is admitted to the hospital, the anesthesia department can understand the patient's condition and the difficulty of anesthesia treatment, which is convenient for arranging anesthesia work appropriately. Pre-anesthesia examination, evaluation and preparation are currently carried out in the ward. With the acceleration of the hospital modernization process, hospitals with conditions should gradually transfer this work to the outpatient department. item Follow-up and treatment of anesthetic complications It is very necessary for anesthesiologists to personally diagnose and treat post-anesthetic complications. At present, the diagnosis and treatment of anesthetic complications is not the responsibility of anesthesiologists, especially after patients are discharged from the hospital, anesthesiologists have no opportunity to diagnose and treat these patients, and the treatment effect is not ideal. With the establishment of anesthesia clinics, this situation will change, which is beneficial to patients. item Pre-anesthetic consultation or consultation. item Respiratory therapy, drug dependence withdrawal treatment (\"drug rehabilitation\"), etc. item Pain diagnosis and treatment can be opened separately in pain diagnosis and treatment clinics or multidisciplinary pain diagnosis and treatment centers, and corresponding wards can be established. end{enumerate} {(II) Clinical anesthesia} The workplace of clinical anesthesia is mainly in the operating room, and it has now expanded to outside the operating room. It has developed rapidly and has become an important branch of clinical anesthesia. Anesthesia outside the operating room refers to anesthesia treatment outside the ward operating room in a broad sense, including outpatient surgery. In a narrow sense, it refers to anesthesia, analgesia and sedation outside the outpatient (emergency) and ward operating room, including interventional treatment, endoscopic examination and painless treatment of various departments. In anesthesiology departments with larger scale and better conditions, branch disciplines (or sub-disciplines) of clinical anesthesia should also be established, such as cardiovascular surgery, thoracic surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics and pediatric surgery anesthesia, so as to cultivate specialized talents and improve the medical quality of specialized anesthesia. {1. Main work content of clinical anesthesia} (1) Conduct preoperative examination, condition assessment and preparation for patients. (2) Provide basic conditions such as sedation, painlessness, no unpleasant memories, muscle relaxation and reasonable control of stress response for the smooth operation. (3) Provide special conditions necessary for completing the operation, such as endotracheal and bronchial intubation, controlled hypotension, artificial ventilation, hypothermia and extracorporeal circulation. (4) Conduct comprehensive, continuous and quantitative monitoring of the vital functions of surgical patients, and adjust and control them within the normal or expected range to maintain the life safety of patients. It should be pointed out that monitoring and regulating the vital functions of patients is the essence of clinical anesthesia. Therefore, the anesthesiology department must not only be equipped with complete and advanced instruments and equipment, but also continuously improve the knowledge, quality and ability of anesthesiologists. Only in this way can timely and accurate judgments and treatments be made. (5) Establish PACU and carry out scientific management to prevent and treat various complications at an early stage, and ensure the smooth recovery of patients after surgery. (6) Actively create conditions to carry out \"anesthesia outside the operating room\" or \"anesthesia for non-hospitalized patients\" to facilitate patients and save medical resources. However, it must be implemented in a prepared manner, and corresponding norms and systems must be established before implementation to ensure patient safety. (7) Carry out postoperative analgesia. Anesthesiology departments with conditions should establish a postoperative analgesia information management system and information database. (8) Establish an anesthesia department information management system and strengthen scientific management to improve medical quality and work efficiency. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Common methods of clinical anesthesia Although there are many methods (techniques) and drugs for clinical anesthesia, they can be divided into two categories according to the different parts of the nervous system where anesthetics act (Table 1-1): local (regional) anesthesia and general anesthesia. end{enumerate} Table 1-1 Classification of basic methods of clinical anesthesia begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} hline Classification & Method of anesthesia & Method of administration of anesthetics & Site of action of anesthetics hline multirow[t]{2}{*}{General anesthesia} & Inhalation general anesthesia & begin{tabular}{l} Inhalation through the respiratory tract Intravenous injection end{tabular} & Central nervous system hline & Intravenous general anesthesia & begin{tabular}{l} Intramuscular injection Rectal irrigation end{tabular} & hline Local (regional) anesthesia & begin{tabular}{l} Subarachnoid block Epidural block Nerve trunk (plexus) block Local infiltration anesthesia end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Injection of local anesthetic into the subarachnoid space Injection of local anesthetic into the epidural space Injection of local anesthetic into the nerve trunk (plexus) Local infiltration of local anesthetic end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Subarachnoid spinal nerve Epidural spinal nerve Nerve trunk (plexus) Skin and mucosal nerve endings end{tabular} hline end{tabular} end{center} Currently, single drugs or single methods are rarely used for anesthesia. Compound anesthesia or balanced anesthesia and combined anesthesia are more commonly used in clinical practice. Compound anesthesia refers to the use of two or more anesthetics and (or) auxiliary drugs at the same time to achieve the basic requirements of anesthesia, so as to reduce the dosage and side effects of a single drug, such as the use of sedatives, anesthetic analgesics and muscle relaxants for intravenous compound general anesthesia. Combined anesthesia refers to the use of two or more methods at the same time to achieve the basic requirements of anesthesia, so as to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses and give full play to the advantages of various methods, such as the combined use of general anesthesia and epidural block. {(III) Postanesthesia care unit (PACU)} PACU is an important place to continue to observe the condition after the operation, prevent and deal with short-term complications after anesthesia, ensure patient safety, and improve medical quality. PACU should be equipped with special nurses and doctors to manage patients, and patients can be sent back to the ward after they are awake and their vital signs are stable. PACU can effectively prevent early complications after anesthesia, eliminate malignant medical accidents, shorten the patient's stay in the operating room, and improve the utilization rate of the operating table. It is a successful and mature experience both internationally and domestically. If the patient's condition is unstable, such as respiratory and circulatory dysfunction, he should be sent to the ICU in time. {(IV) Anesthesia ICU} refers to the ICU under the charge of the anesthesia department, which is mainly for postoperative patients. It is an important link in the diagnosis and treatment of perioperative critical illnesses, ensuring the safety of major operations, and improving medical quality. It is an inevitable product of modern high-level and high-efficiency hospitals. The characteristics of ICU are: (1) equipped with advanced equipment to monitor the patient's vital functions comprehensively, continuously and quantitatively; (2) equipped with early diagnosis and advanced treatment equipment and technology; (3) adopting modern management, thus having high work efficiency and rescue success rate; (4) having a well-trained medical care team. The patients admitted to ICU are jointly managed by anesthesiologists and surgeons. The main tasks of anesthesiologists are: to monitor the patients comprehensively, continuously and quantitatively; to maintain the patient's body fluid homeostasis; to support the stability of circulation, respiratory and other functions; to prevent and treat infection; to diagnose and treat various complications and provide nutritional support at an early stage. Surgeons focus on primary diseases and specialist treatment. Once the functions of the patient's important organs are basically stable, they can be transferred back to the original ward. {(V) Pain diagnosis and treatment} Pain diagnosis and treatment is an important part of the work of the Department of Anesthesiology. In view of the multidisciplinary nature of pain and the characteristics of the work of the Department of Anesthesiology, the pain diagnosis and treatment of the Department of Anesthesiology is based on acute pain diagnosis and treatment and features chronic pain diagnosis and treatment. The work content of pain diagnosis and treatment in the Department of Anesthesiology mainly includes: postoperative analgesia and diagnosis and treatment of acute pain, diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain, painless diagnosis and treatment, and even painless hospitals are the responsibilities of the Department of Anesthesiology. When conducting the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain, the multidisciplinary nature of pain diagnosis and treatment and the importance of clinical diagnosis should be emphasized. Therefore, physicians engaged in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain must have a solid foundation in clinical diagnosis and treatment in related departments, and must have the qualification of attending physicians in the Department of Anesthesiology and then undergo professional training before they can be competent. {II. Scientific research work} Scientific research is an important work content of the Department of Anesthesiology. The construction of the discipline connotation should be based on clinical practice, guided by scientific research, and fundamental to education. Scientific research work should clarify the research direction, formulate plans, organize implementation, and summarize regularly. Scientific research work should pay special attention to two issues. First, it is necessary to establish the awareness that \"clinical work is one step forward in scientific research\", that is, in daily work, we should be attentive, good at raising questions, pay attention to choosing the right topic, solve problems through research and innovation, and improve records, accumulate data, statistically analyze, and write papers. Second, we should strive to develop anesthesiology research from indicator dependence to thinking dependence, and we should effectively transform from indicator dependence to thinking dependence. The core of thinking is innovation, and the way of thinking is practice-theory-re-practice. We should combine production, learning and research. This is an important way to improve the level of clinical medical care and the academic status of anesthesia. In hospitals with conditions, anesthesiology laboratories or anesthesiology research rooms can be established. When the anesthesia department establishes a research room (or laboratory), the director (or deputy director) of the anesthesia department should also serve as the director of the research room (or laboratory). When establishing a research room (or laboratory), the following basic conditions must be met: begin{enumerate} item There must be a discipline or academic leader with a high academic level, rigorous academic research, and a title of associate professor or deputy chief physician or above; item Form a relatively stable research direction and have corresponding research topics or funds; item Equipped with full-time laboratory personnel and instruments and equipment necessary for conducting research; item A rationally structured talent team must be formed, mainly including research backbones, researchers, technicians and managers. end{enumerate} {III. Education} The goal of medical education in my country in the early 21st century is to establish a continuous and unified lifelong medical education system including basic education (BE), postgraduate education (PGE) and continuing medical education (CME), and anesthesia is no exception. BE is mainly the independent teaching of \"Anesthesiology\" in clinical medicine and graduate education. The independent teaching of \"Anesthesiology\" is the need for the knowledge structure of medical students, the need for the connection between basic education and postgraduate education, and the need for the construction and development of the secondary discipline of anesthesiology. PGE refers to residency training, or standardized residency training, which means three years of residency training after graduating from undergraduate school (\"$5+3$\" or \"7+2\" model); CME is mainly for attending physicians and above. This is an important way to improve the quality and level of anesthesiologists, and efforts should be made to continuously standardize, institutionalize and legalize it. In order to better promote the development of ICU and pain diagnosis and treatment in my country, we should actively create conditions and implement the training and admission system for ICU and pain diagnosis and treatment physicians. Medical schools (schools) affiliated hospitals should actively create conditions to establish anesthesiology teaching and research departments. Medical schools with multiple affiliated hospitals can establish anesthesiology departments to unify the organization to complete the above tasks. {Section 4: Learn Anesthesiology Well} In order to provide basic anesthesiology education for clinical medicine students in medical schools, this course, in addition to briefly describing the basic techniques and methods of anesthesiology, focuses on: (1) Monitoring, regulation and control of human life functions, such as airway management and monitoring of breathing, oxygen supply and demand balance, hemodynamics and fluid balance; (2) First aid and diagnosis and treatment knowledge for critically ill patients such as shock, ALI, ARDS, MODS and cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation; (3) Basic knowledge of pain diagnosis and treatment and drug dependence and withdrawal. It should be pointed out that these contents are the common foundation for a good clinical physician. Therefore, they are the needs of the knowledge structure of medical students, and they are also the basis and needs for further development of medical students after entering various clinical specialties. They are the important basis for clinical physicians to macro-control the diagnosis and treatment of patients, emergency response capabilities, and the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients. We must study carefully, focus on understanding, pay attention to the connection and communication with related courses, so as to be able to draw inferences from one example. It should be emphasized that my country's anesthesia discipline has made great progress in the past 20 years, but the development is very unbalanced. On the whole, the discipline is currently in an important stage of development from a tertiary discipline to a secondary discipline platform. I believe that through hard work, my country's anesthesia will quickly enter the international advanced platform.\n",
      "{Chapter 2 Preoperative Condition Assessment and Preparation for Surgical Patients} Preoperative condition assessment of surgical patients is an important part of ensuring the safety of surgical patients. Preoperative condition assessment is a vital task not only for anesthesiologists but also for doctors in the surgical department. Its significance involves ensuring the safety of patients during anesthesia and surgery, as well as reducing the incidence and mortality of perioperative complications. Most anesthetics have a very obvious effect on the functions of important organs and systems of the body, such as the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The therapeutic index (median lethal dose/median effective dose) of anesthetics is only $3 sim 4$. In contrast, the therapeutic index of most non-anesthetic drugs is hundreds or even thousands. Such a narrow safety range of anesthetics illustrates the risk of anesthesia itself. However, the more important aspect is the patient's condition and the complexity of the operation, as well as the patient's tolerance for anesthesia and surgery. Therefore, the danger of anesthesia, the complexity of the operation and the patient's tolerance are the key points of pre-anesthetic condition assessment. The birth of anesthesia is a milestone in the development of surgery, and the development of modern anesthesia has greatly promoted and guaranteed the progress of surgery. An ordinary surgical patient may have serious medical diseases, such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc. With the advent of an aging society, it is no longer uncommon for centenarians to undergo surgery. With the development of science today, many contraindications to surgery in the past have now become indications for surgery because they can improve organ function, such as emergency coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with acute myocardial infarction, lung volume reduction surgery for patients with advanced and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and organ transplantation for patients with end-stage organ failure. There are almost no contraindications to surgery in surgery. However, facing such surgery brings great risks and challenges to anesthesia. The preoperative evaluation and preparation of surgical patients includes: (1) a comprehensive understanding of the patient's overall health and specific condition; (2) an assessment of the patient's tolerance to anesthesia and surgery; (3) clarifying the dangers of various organ diseases and special conditions, what complications may occur during surgery, and what preventive and therapeutic measures need to be taken; (4) selecting preanesthetic medications and anesthesia methods, and formulating specific anesthesia implementation plans and anesthesia equipment preparations. In order to effectively carry out preoperative condition assessment and preparation, it is required that: (1) fully understand the importance of preoperative condition assessment and preparation for surgical patients; (2) understand the process of pre-anesthetic visits and examinations; (3) have a preliminary understanding of the particularity of pre-anesthetic preparation; (4) master the principles of pre-anesthetic medication. {Section 1 Preoperative visits and preoperative condition assessment clinics} {(I) Preoperative visits by anesthesiologists} Currently in China, for most patients, anesthesiologists usually conduct preoperative visits one day before the surgery after receiving the surgical notice. For high-risk patients and patients with special circumstances, surgeons will consult anesthesiologists a few days before the surgery and conduct multidisciplinary preoperative discussions when necessary. Therefore, the time of preoperative visits is affected by the patient's underlying disease, the type of surgery, and the medical system. The process of the anesthesiologist's preoperative visit mainly includes: reviewing medical records, checking various preoperative laboratory tests, visiting patients to understand anesthesia-related medical history and reviewing various systems, conducting physical examinations and functional tests of important systems, and finally assessing and judging the patient's anesthesia and surgical risks, and formulating a perioperative anesthesia plan. Explain the patient's condition, anesthesia method, and the risks of surgical anesthesia, as well as necessary preoperative preparations, such as fasting before surgery, to the patient and the patient's family, and sign an informed consent for anesthesia. In order to ensure the preoperative visit of the anesthesiologist, the surgeon needs to complete all necessary preparations and examinations before surgery. After the patient is admitted to the hospital, various preoperative laboratory tests generally take $2 sim 3$ days to report, so the patient needs to wait about a week before surgery, which significantly prolongs the hospitalization time. Internationally, with the development of day surgery, the demand for fast-track and shortened hospital stay, average hospital stay, and increased ward bed turnover, surgical patients, even those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, are often admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery, and the surgery is performed immediately after admission. After the surgery, the decision on whether to stay for observation or hospitalization depends on the condition and recovery. This has greatly changed the timing of preoperative evaluation, requiring patients to complete preoperative examinations and evaluations in the outpatient clinic before surgery. Therefore, the anesthesiology preoperative condition evaluation clinic came into being. The development of the preoperative condition evaluation clinic has reduced the average hospital stay for general surgery in developed countries to $3-4 days, and the average hospital stay for neurosurgery and cardiac surgery to $6-8 days. This is equivalent to increasing medical resources without increasing investment or only increasing a small amount of investment. {(II) Anesthesiology preoperative condition evaluation clinic} The anesthesiology preoperative condition evaluation clinic has just started in only a few hospitals in my country. The establishment and operation of the anesthesiology preoperative condition evaluation clinic is for the needs of the development of hospitals and medical work, and cannot be separated from the support of hospitals and various disciplines. For patients who come to the outpatient clinic for elective surgery, after completing the necessary routine and specialist examinations, the surgeon recommends that the patient visit the anesthesiology department's preoperative condition assessment clinic before deciding to be admitted to the hospital. The anesthesia clinic is usually managed by a senior anesthesiologist, who assesses the patient's tolerance to anesthesia based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and auxiliary examinations. For patients with incomplete laboratory tests and auxiliary examinations, further relevant examinations are required for their specific diseases. For patients with unsatisfactory control of comorbidities, it is recommended to consult with relevant departments to adjust the treatment method and drug dosage. Finally, explain to the patient the possible anesthesia methods for the relevant surgery. Complete a simple preoperative condition assessment medical record or assessment form and list the patient's main problems. On the day the patient is admitted to the hospital, the physician in charge of anesthesia reviews the patient's preoperative condition assessment medical record or assessment form and asks the patient some basic information to understand the patient's specific condition at a glance, and select the appropriate anesthesia method and monitoring method to ensure the safety of anesthesia. In addition to reducing hospital stays and speeding up bed turnover, the opening of anesthesia assessment clinics is more important for patients with comorbidities to undergo systematic and comprehensive preoperative examinations and receive timely treatment and good control. Patients can be scheduled for surgery on the same day or as soon as possible after admission; avoid delaying surgery due to poor control of comorbidities or incomplete preoperative examination results; and improve the safety of surgical anesthesia. Since the opening of the preoperative condition assessment clinic in the Department of Anesthesiology at Washington University Hospital in St. Louis, $80%$ of elective surgery patients have gone through the preoperative assessment clinic, avoiding the situation of delayed surgery for some reason. In addition, patients can have a preliminary understanding of anesthesia before hospitalization to reduce their fear of anesthesia and unnecessary worries. {Section 2 Process and Methods of Preoperative Condition Assessment} {I. Process of Preoperative Condition Assessment} begin{enumerate} item Review of Medical Records (History) The first step in preoperative condition assessment is to obtain sufficient medical history from the medical records, mainly including surgical diseases and surgical conditions, as well as coexisting medical diseases and treatment conditions. end{enumerate} Surgical situation: Understand the diagnosis of surgical diseases, the purpose of surgery, the site, incision, the extent of organ removal, the difficulty of surgery, the expected degree of bleeding, the duration of surgery and the degree of risk of surgery, and whether special anesthesia techniques are required (such as hypothermia, controlled hypotension, etc.). Internal medicine: Understand the patient's personal history, past medical history, previous surgeries, anesthesia history, and treatment and medication history. Identify coexisting internal medicine diseases and their severity, current treatment status, recent examination results, and whether further laboratory tests and special functional tests are needed. If necessary, consult with relevant specialists to assist in evaluating the functional status of related organs and discuss further surgical preparation measures. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Analyze the results of various preoperative examinations and tests Patients who are scheduled for elective surgery usually undergo a series of routine preoperative examinations (Table 2-1). However, there is currently no unified conclusion or guideline on which examinations and tests are necessary or routine before surgery. Usually, before surgery, hospital patients complete three routine tests of blood, urine, and feces, blood coagulation time, blood biochemistry (liver and kidney function) tests, electrocardiograms, and tests for infectious diseases (such as hepatitis B, HIV, etc.). For patients with medical diseases, further examinations are performed according to the condition: chest X-ray examination, pulmonary function test, arterial blood gas analysis, cardiac function test, and necessary specialist examinations and tests. The purpose is to help medical staff have a comprehensive or full understanding of the patient's condition, so as to make a correct assessment, reduce the adverse factors affecting anesthesia management, and increase the safety of surgery and anesthesia. Table 2-1 Standards for preoperative laboratory and special examinations for surgical patients (minimum standards) end{enumerate} begin{center} begin{tabular}{ll} hline Required examination items & 1. Routine blood test Including platelet count and hematocrit (Hct) if necessary 2. Routine urine test Including microscopic examination and urine specific gravity & 3. Routine urine test & 4. Liver function Including plasma protein, bile pigment, and transaminase determination & 5. Renal function Including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) determination & 6. Examinations for infectious diseases Mainly including relevant examinations for HBV, HIV, etc. & 7. Coagulation mechanism Including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen content & end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Preoperative visits and examinations Anesthesiologists should visit patients before surgery to further understand the patient's medical history that may be related to anesthesia from the perspective of anesthesiologists, and conduct systematic interviews and physical examinations, which can often provide very important first-hand information. At the same time, it can help patients understand issues related to anesthesia, eliminate tension and anxiety, and establish a good doctor-patient relationship. If the patient is a child, it is important to help the child and parents prepare psychologically for surgical anesthesia. end{enumerate} Physical examination mainly checks the patient's vital signs and observes the patient's overall condition. The focus of systematic interviews is the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, nervous system, coagulation, liver function, kidney function and endocrine system. The ultimate goal of all these preoperative examinations is to make an assessment of the patient's anesthesia and surgical risks. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Make an anesthesia and surgical risk assessment Based on the results of the pre-anesthesia visit, a comprehensive analysis of the risks of surgery and anesthesia is conducted. The patient's overall physical health status grading issued by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is one of the more commonly used assessment and grading methods for clinical anesthesia. Its grading standards are shown in Table 2-2. Patients of grades I and II generally have good tolerance to anesthesia and the anesthesia process is smooth; patients of grade III are at certain risk for anesthesia and need to be as fully prepared as possible before anesthesia, and active and effective preventive measures should be taken for possible complications during and after anesthesia; patients of grades IV and V are at great risk for anesthesia, and adequate and meticulous preparation before anesthesia is particularly important. end{enumerate} Table 2-2 ASA grading of anesthesia condition assessment [ begin{aligned} & grading multicolumn{1}{c}{ standard } & Grade I No organic disease, good development and nutrition, able to tolerate anesthesia and surgery & Grade II Although there are mild lesions in the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and other solid organs, but the compensation is sound, can tolerate general anesthesia and surgery & Grade III The heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and other solid organs have serious lesions and reduced functions, but are still within the compensation range, and the tolerance to anesthesia and surgery is slightly poor & Grade IV The above solid organs have serious lesions and incomplete functional compensation, threatening life safety, and anesthesia and surgery require great risks & Grade V The condition is critical, with the threat of death at any time, and anesthesia and surgery are very dangerous end{aligned} ] Note: If it is an emergency, mark \"urgent\" or \" $E$ (emergency)\" before each level number begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Informed consent Informed consent is a necessary part of preoperative evaluation and has become an indispensable legal document. After the patient is explained the side effects, risks and complications of the treatment or diagnostic operation, and the patient agrees and signs, informed consent is obtained. The purpose is to provide patients with the information they need to make a reasonable choice. Explaining the anesthesia plan and possible complications is very important for establishing a good relationship between the patient and the physician, and can prevent possible disputes in the future. In some cases, only the patient's relatives or authorized persons can sign the informed consent form. end{enumerate} {II. Methods of preoperative condition assessment}\n",
      "{(I) Overall assessment method} Preoperative condition assessment is both a science and an art. Experienced anesthesiologists can quickly grasp some key points and make basic assessments and judgments. These include the patient's own conditions, general condition, the presence and severity of complications, important organ functions, and the complexity of the surgical operation. begin{enumerate} item Patient's own conditions As my country has entered an aging society, the patient's age has become an important risk factor for anesthesia. The operation performed on the patient may be a general operation, but if the patient is an elderly patient, the risk of anesthesia is much higher than that of a younger patient. item General condition It is very important to judge the patient's tolerance to anesthesia, such as mental state, development, nutrition, anemia, dehydration, edema, cyanosis, fever, excessive weight loss or obesity, etc. item Coexisting diseases and organ functions The patient may undergo a general operation, but if one or more coexisting diseases exist, the risk of anesthesia will increase, such as coexisting heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc. However, even for elderly patients with multiple coexisting diseases, their tolerance to anesthesia mainly depends on the functional status of important vital organs, especially the compensation and quality of heart and lung function. Therefore, in the system evaluation, the focus is on the respiratory system and cardiovascular system. Item The complexity of surgical procedures does not seem to be within the scope of the patient's condition, but it is closely related to the condition. The risk of anesthesia is not completely consistent with the size of the operation. Complex operations can significantly increase the risk of anesthesia. Sometimes the operation is not complicated, but the patient's condition and coexisting diseases bring more risks to anesthesia. Factors such as complex surgery, long operation time, and large amount of bleeding significantly increase the risk of anesthesia and surgery for patients. However, although some operations are complex, they can improve or restore the patient's organ function, such as coronary artery bypass grafting, lung volume reduction surgery, organ transplantation, etc., which undoubtedly brings new challenges to preoperative condition assessment. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Assessment of cardiovascular risk} Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery should be aware of cardiovascular diseases, such as congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, coronary artery sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, large vessel disease, hypertension and arrhythmia. The main factors related to anesthesia risk are cardiac function status and certain special risk factors, such as unstable angina, recent (<6 months) myocardial infarction, fatal arrhythmia, etc. Good preoperative cardiac function often reflects that the patient has a strong compensatory ability and tolerance for surgical anesthesia. In addition to providing changes in the anatomical structure of the heart, echocardiography can also assess ventricular function. One of the most important indicators is ventricular ejection fraction $( mathrm{EF})$. If $ mathrm{EF}<50%$, it is a moderate-risk patient, and $ mathrm{EF}<25%$, it is a high-risk patient. begin{enumerate} item Bedside test methods Anesthesiologists can use some simple bedside tests to determine the patient's current cardiopulmonary reserve capacity: end{enumerate} (1) Breath holding test: First, ask the patient to take a few deep breaths, then hold his breath after the deep inhalation, and record the time he can hold his breath. Generally, a breath holding time of more than 30 seconds is considered normal; a breath holding time of less than 20 seconds can be considered to have significantly incomplete cardiopulmonary function. (2) Stair climbing test: If the patient can climb three floors at his own pace without bending over, it means that the cardiopulmonary reserve capacity is still good, and the perioperative morbidity and mortality are significantly low. (3) 6-minute walk test: A method for quantitative analysis of cardiopulmonary function. Measuring maximal oxygen consumption (maximal oxygen consumption, $ left. mathrm{VO}_{2} mathrm{max} right)$ during exercise is an accurate preoperative assessment method to determine whether the patient will develop pulmonary complications after thoracotomy. If the patient's $ mathrm{VO}_{2} max geqslant 20 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{kg})$, there are few pulmonary complications; when $ mathrm{VO}_{2} max leqslant 10 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{kg})$, there is a high risk, and the short-term mortality rate is greater than $ 30 % $. The 6-minute walk test and $ mathrm{VO}_{2}$ max have a good correlation. If the patient's 6-minute walking distance reaches $360 mathrm{~m}$, then $ mathrm{VO}_{2} mathrm{max}$ is approximately $12 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{kg})$; if the 6-minute walking distance is less than $660 mathrm{~m}$, it means that $ mathrm{VO}_{2}$ max is less than $15 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{kg})$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item The Goldman cardiac risk index (CRI) has been used in clinical anesthesia for 30 years. Although there is some controversy, it is still the basis for assessing perioperative cardiac risk (Table 2-3). The higher the CRI, the greater the cardiac risk (Table 2-4). Of the total score of 53 points, 28 points can be corrected through active preoperative preparation and treatment, such as heart failure, arrhythmia, hypoxemia, etc. Improvement of the condition can reduce the risks of anesthesia and surgery. end{enumerate} Table 2-3.

A comprehensive assessment of the patient's perioperative risk should be conducted based on the risk levels of the three factors. end{enumerate} (1) Risk factors of the patient: (1) High-risk risk factors: new myocardial infarction ($<6$ weeks), unstable angina, myocardial ischemia after myocardial infarction, ischemic and congestive heart failure, severe arrhythmia, coronary revascularization within the past 40 days, etc. High-risk patients are only suitable for emergency or life-saving surgery. (2) Intermediate risk factors: recent myocardial infarction (>6 weeks and <3 months) without sequelae or myocardial instability, stable angina under drug control (grade I-II), previous perioperative ischemic events, diabetes, low ejection fraction (EF<0.35), compensated heart failure. (3) Low risk factors: age 70 years, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within 6 years without residual myocardial ischemia. (2) The patient's functional status: usually evaluated by his or her tolerance to physical activity. Exercise tolerance test is an important method for assessing the patient's perioperative risk. In the bicycle exercise test, patients who experience myocardial ischemia during low-intensity exercise (heart rate < 100 beats/min) are high-risk patients; patients who do not show ischemia during high-intensity exercise (heart rate > 130 beats/min) are low-risk patients. Patients who cannot walk up two flights of stairs continuously have cardiopulmonary complications after surgery, accounting for $89%$. The patient's tolerance to activity can also be expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs), $1 mathrm{MET}$ consumes approximately $3.5 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ of oxygen. The patient's usual activity capacity can be used to indirectly determine his oxygen consumption, thereby evaluating his tolerance to anesthesia and surgery (Table 2-5). Functional status assessment: $>10 mathrm{METs}$ is excellent, $7 sim 10 mathrm{METs}$ is good, $4 sim 7 mathrm{METs}$ is moderate, and $<4 mathrm{METs}$ is poor. Studies have found that if the patient's activity level is less than $4 sim 5$ metabolic equivalents, various complications are prone to occur during the perioperative period. For patients with good functional status, the results of any further examinations will rarely change the treatment plan, and surgery can be performed as originally planned.

Compared with patients without kidney disease, patients with kidney disease, such as preoperative creatinine levels $>124 mu mathrm{mol} / mathrm{L}(1.4 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{dl})$, are risk factors for postoperative renal insufficiency and increased long-term morbidity and mortality. {(III) Assessment of respiratory function} begin{enumerate} item Risk factors Postoperative pulmonary complications are the second leading cause of perioperative death after cardiovascular disease. Risk factors include: (1) degree of pulmonary function impairment; (2) chronic lung disease, which increases the risk of postoperative respiratory failure; (3) patients with moderate to severe pulmonary insufficiency and those undergoing chest and upper abdominal surgery; (4) patients with $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<60 mathrm{mmHg}, mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>45 mathrm{mmHg}$; (5) a history of smoking; (6) a history of asthma; (7) bronchopulmonary complications. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{2. Evaluation methods} (1) General evaluation methods: Based on relevant medical history and physical signs, we can rule out acute and chronic respiratory infections; whether there is a history of asthma, and whether the patient is an airway hyperresponsiveness patient; for patients with coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), various examinations such as chest imaging, pulmonary function testing, and blood gas analysis are required before surgery to evaluate the patient's lung function. (2) Evaluation of pulmonary function: Preoperative evaluation of the patient's lung function is very important, especially for patients with existing respiratory diseases, or those who need major surgery, or those whose surgery itself may further damage their lung function. The evaluation of lung function can provide a reliable basis for preoperative preparation and respiratory management during and after surgery. Although there are many modern methods for testing lung function and they are becoming more and more advanced, the most important indicators in routine measurements are still some of the most basic indicators (Figure 2-1). For example, if the vital capacity is less than $60%$ of the predicted value, the ventilation reserve percentage $<70%$, and the percentage of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity $left ( mathrm{FEV}_{1.0} / mathrm{FVC} % right) <60%$ or $50%$, there is a risk of respiratory insufficiency after surgery. When $ mathrm{FVC}<15 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$, the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications often increases significantly. Maximum ventilation volume (MVV) is also a valuable indicator. Generally, MVV accounting for $50% sim 60%$ of the predicted value is used as an indicator of surgical safety. Less than $50%$ is low lung function, and less than $30%$ is generally listed as a contraindication for surgery. For those who may undergo pneumonectomy, it is best to perform healthy side lung function testing or split-side lung function testing. Arterial blood gas analysis is simple and easy to perform, and can help understand the patient's pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange functions. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-038} end{center} Figure 2-1 Pulmonary function curve (3) Influence of surgical site: The surgical site is very important when assessing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The risk increases when the incision is adjacent to the diaphragm; upper abdominal surgery and thoracotomy have the highest risk of postoperative respiratory complications, which is $10%$ $40%$. The functional residual capacity and vital capacity decrease after upper abdominal surgery, which can last for 5 to 7 days. Postoperative respiratory complications in non-thoracic and abdominal surgeries are relatively rare. In addition, perioperative anesthesia management, especially airway management, is very difficult for patients with sleep apnea syndrome. Sleep apnea syndrome is defined as recurrent obstructive apnea during sleep, accompanied by daytime sleepiness, mood changes, and changes in cardiopulmonary function. This disease is very common, with about $2% sim 4%$ of middle-aged people suffering from it. Sleep apnea syndrome is common in obese patients. Sleep apnea patients have elevated daytime blood pressure, nocturnal arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, right and left heart failure, ischemic heart disease and increased risk of stroke. {(IV) Assessment of central nervous system function} In addition to intracranial diseases and brain trauma involving issues such as patient consciousness and intracranial pressure, more clinical patients are currently encountering elderly patients with cognitive dysfunction and depression. Whether anesthetics have neurotoxicity and whether they have short-term and long-term effects on postoperative cognitive function is still a controversial topic. Patients with depression should pay attention to whether they take antidepressants for a long time, especially monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Since antidepressants may increase the risk of anesthesia, the issue of whether to stop taking the drugs before anesthesia is involved. The anesthesia risk for patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors is that some adverse reactions may occur during surgery, including hypertensive crisis (especially for those taking indirect vasoconstrictors), arrhythmia, hypotension, delayed awakening or coma, and hyperthermia. Therefore, some scholars recommend that the drug should be discontinued for at least 2 weeks before surgery (the time to eliminate monoamine oxidase inhibitors). However, clinical studies have shown that if monitoring is strengthened and medication is used with caution, anesthetic accidents rarely occur. Based on the above research results, it is now recommended that patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors for a long time can use their drugs until the day of surgery, but attention should be paid to the interaction between monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anesthetic drugs (such as pethidine and ephedrine), and events that excite the sympathetic nervous system (hypotension, hypovolemia, anemia, and hypercapnia) should be avoided. Patients with central nervous system complications, such as sequelae of cerebral infarction, spinal diseases with neurological symptoms, etc., are not contraindicated for anesthesia. However, intraspinal anesthesia and regional block anesthesia should be used with caution to avoid confusion with the neurological complications of this type of anesthesia. {(V) Evaluation of coagulation function} Focus on understanding whether the patient has abnormal bleeding. Coagulation function should be routinely checked before surgery, mainly to measure prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen content. Abnormal bleeding has congenital or acquired causes. According to the results of coagulation mechanism examination, the cause of bleeding and complications should be clarified so that corresponding etiological treatment and systemic supportive treatment can be given in preoperative preparation. Common coagulation abnormalities in surgical patients include: thrombocytopenic purpura, coagulation factor deficiency caused by liver damage or vitamin $ mathrm{K}$ deficiency, hemophilia (type A), etc. Anticoagulants have become a routine treatment for cardiovascular diseases and prevention of perioperative venous blood tests. Special attention should be paid when choosing spinal anesthesia. Once epidural hematoma occurs, the consequences are very serious. Although there are still different opinions on whether to stop taking anticoagulants before surgery and when to stop taking them, it is generally believed that heparin anticoagulants should be stopped before surgery. After stopping taking them, they can be completely excreted from the body after 4 to 5 half-lives. Warfarin is a vitamin K inhibitor. Users must stop taking it for 3-5 days before surgery. Vitamin K can be added if necessary. For emergency surgery, fresh frozen plasma or (and) prothrombin complex (containing vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X) should be prepared for transfusion as appropriate. Vitamin K can also be added. Aspirin is a platelet inhibitor. Its inhibitory effect is irreversible. If the drug needs to be stopped before surgery, it will take more than 1 week for the newly generated platelets to play a role. However, it is currently believed that aspirin does not need to be stopped before surgery, especially for patients who have recently undergone coronary artery balloon dilatation or stenting. Dual anticoagulation therapy is often used, clopidogrel sulfate (Plavix) and aspirin. If such patients need emergency surgery, they must take aspirin into the operating room according to the guidelines. For surgical patients who are at risk of stopping anticoagulants before surgery, low molecular weight heparin is a good alternative. Usually low molecular weight heparin is taken twice a day, and only needs to be stopped once on the morning of the surgery. Table 2-6 introduces the guidelines for the use of low molecular weight heparin during epidural block or postoperative epidural analgesia. Table 2-6 Guidelines for the use of low molecular weight heparin during epidural block or postoperative analgesia begin{enumerate} item Epidural catheter should be placed at least $1 mathrm{~h}$ before heparin use ($24 mathrm{~h}$ before cardiac surgery) item Epidural catheter should be removed at least $10 sim 12 mathrm{~h}$ after heparin is stopped item Heparin can be continued $2 mathrm{~h}$ after epidural catheter removal item During epidural catheter placement, it is recommended that low molecular weight heparin be changed from 2 times/day to 1 time/day end{enumerate} {Section 3 Pre-anesthetic preparation and medication} {I. Pre-anesthetic preparation} There is no strict difference in the meaning between pre-anesthetic preparation and pre-operative preparation, because their purpose and main content are the same or completely consistent, so these two words are often used interchangeably. Which word to use depends entirely on the user's expertise or habits. One of the tasks of anesthesiologists is to participate in preoperative preparation, but they cannot complete all the tasks of preanesthetic preparation independently. Therefore, good preanesthetic or preoperative preparation requires the cooperation of anesthesiologists and surgical doctors. The purpose of preanesthetic preparation is to put the patient in the best physical and mental state, so as to enhance the patient's tolerance to anesthesia and surgery, improve the patient's safety during anesthesia, avoid the occurrence of anesthesia accidents, and reduce post-anesthesia complications. The tasks of preanesthetic preparation include: (1) to prepare the patient's physical and mental aspects, which is the first task; (2) to give the patient appropriate preanesthetic medication; (3) to prepare anesthesia equipment, equipment, monitoring equipment and drugs (including emergency drugs). There is a big difference between being fully prepared before anesthesia and not being fully prepared. Some adverse events of anesthesia are related to insufficient preparation, such as the patient's serious condition without adequate preparation, the anesthetic equipment malfunctioning or malfunctioning during use without prior inspection and maintenance, and the use of other gases as oxygen without careful verification. In short, it is inevitable that problems will arise if we take it lightly, neglect it, or rush into the operation. If we can strengthen our sense of responsibility and do a good job of preparing for anesthesia, then the adverse events of anesthesia related to this can be prevented. {(I) Improve the patient's general condition} Before anesthesia surgery, we should try our best to improve the patient's general condition and take corresponding measures to keep the functions of various organs in the best state. At the same time, we should also stop smoking; prepare our thoughts and mental state before surgery; strengthen our physical strength, improve cardiopulmonary reserve function, and increase our tolerance to anesthesia and surgery. Malnutrition can lead to decreased plasma albumin, anemia, insufficient blood volume, and certain vitamin deficiencies, which reduce the patient's ability to tolerate anesthesia, surgical trauma, and blood loss. Therefore, the malnutrition status should be improved before surgery, generally requiring hemoglobin $ geqslant 80 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, plasma albumin $ geqslant 30 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, and correct dehydration, electrolyte disorders, and acid-base imbalances. Although there is no evidence that reaching this value can improve the perioperative outcome of patients, it may be beneficial for patients with acute anemia and cardiopulmonary diseases to increase hemoglobin before medium and large operations (intrathoracic, large blood vessels, upper abdomen, and internal surgery); and patients with chronic anemia caused by kidney disease and dialysis without cardiopulmonary disease can tolerate a certain degree of anemia well. It may be more meaningful to weigh the relationship between hemoglobin level and the patient's underlying disease. Most of the shock patients encountered in surgery are hypovolemic or septic shock, and blood volume needs to be supplemented to improve circulatory function and tissue perfusion. Generally, anesthesia and surgery should be performed only after the shock is corrected. However, if the operation itself is a means or the main measure to eliminate the cause of shock, and it is difficult to correct the shock without surgery or even endanger the patient's life, anesthesia and surgery should be performed while correcting the shock. {(II) Preparation of the respiratory system} For elective surgery patients with acute respiratory infection before surgery, the surgery should be suspended. Generally, surgery should be performed one week after the infection is fully controlled, otherwise the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications will increase significantly. For patients with chronic respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis, chronic lung abscess, severe bronchiectasis, etc., the infection should be controlled as much as possible before surgery. Airway hyperresponsiveness is common in patients with a history of asthma, bronchospasm and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In order to prevent bronchospasm during surgery, bronchodilators and corticosteroids can be used before surgery to reduce its risk. $ beta_{2}$-sympathomimetic aerosol is an effective drug for the treatment and prevention of intraoperative bronchospasm. The principles of preoperative preparation for COPD patients are: control respiratory tract infection; clear airway secretions; treat bronchospasm; improve respiratory function; and improve the patient's exercise capacity and tolerance. Patients who have developed cor pulmonale should also pay attention to controlling pulmonary hypertension and improving heart function. Smokers should routinely stop smoking for at least 2 weeks before surgery. However, there is evidence that stopping smoking for more than 4 weeks can effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Pulmonary function tests should be performed on patients with the following factors before surgery: (1) a history of lung disease; (2) patients with factors that limit pulmonary ventilation, including obesity (more than 20% of standard body weight), kyphoscoliosis, and neuromuscular junction disease; (3) surgeries that significantly affect pulmonary ventilation, such as diaphragmatic hernia, intrathoracic and chest wall surgery, and upper abdominal surgery in patients over 60 years of age; (4) heavy smokers (more than 20 packs per month); (5) patients with recent (<30 days) upper respiratory tract infection; and (6) patients over 65 years of age.\n",
      "{(III) Preparation of the cardiovascular system} With the development of society and medicine, most congenital heart diseases have been treated at an early stage. Patients with acquired heart disease who undergo non-cardiac surgery are often encountered in daily surgery. The most common is ischemic heart disease, which is the main cause of perioperative death. The main risk factors include: (1) history of congestive heart failure; (2) unstable angina; (3) old myocardial infarction (<6 months); (4) hypertension; (5) arrhythmia; (6) previous heart surgery. Secondary risk factors: (1) diabetes; (2) smoking; (3) hyperlipidemia; (4) obesity; (5) advanced age. The key to anesthesia and preoperative evaluation and preparation is to correctly evaluate the status of cardiac function and effectively improve cardiac function. The quality of cardiac function is directly related to the risk of anesthesia and surgery. Other secondary risk factors should be controlled as much as possible before surgery and adjusted to the best possible state. Primary hypertension is also a common complication before surgery. For patients with hypertension, it is necessary to understand the methods of medical treatment, medication and side effects, whether there is evidence of damage to important organs and cardiovascular disease, and decide whether to perform surgery when hypertension is not well controlled. If the preoperative assessment of hypertension is mild or moderate, and there is no metabolic disorder or cardiovascular system abnormality, the operation can be carried out as planned. Patients with significantly elevated blood pressure [i.e. systolic blood pressure $>180 mathrm{mmHg}$ and (or) diastolic blood pressure $>110 mathrm{mmHg}$] should control their blood pressure before surgery. Patients with poor preoperative blood pressure control may experience significant blood pressure fluctuations and electrocardiographic manifestations of myocardial ischemia during the perioperative period. Taking effective measures to control refractory hypertension before surgery is conducive to maintaining perioperative hemodynamic stability, effectively controlling perioperative blood pressure fluctuations, and reducing the number and duration of perioperative coronary artery ischemic events. Preoperative use of $ beta$ receptor antagonists in patients with coronary artery disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease can reduce the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases during non-cardiac surgery. When diastolic blood pressure is higher than $110 mathrm{mmHg}$, all surgical operations except for emergencies should be postponed. If diastolic blood pressure is lower than $110 mathrm{mmHg}$, surgery can be performed because no studies have shown that this level of diastolic blood pressure is directly related to postoperative cardiac or renal complications. However, it is worth noting that patients with preoperative hypertension (treated or untreated) have dramatic perioperative blood pressure fluctuations, or a sharp increase in blood pressure due to endotracheal intubation and strong surgical stimulation, or severe hypotension when maintaining the same depth of anesthesia and mild surgical stimulation. Hemodynamic instability may increase the incidence of perioperative cardiac complications. Before surgery, patients take various therapeutic drugs, such as antihypertensive drugs, antianginal drugs (beta receptor antagonists), antiarrhythmic drugs, digitalis, and endocrine drugs (insulin). It is generally not recommended to stop taking drugs before anesthesia. Otherwise, it will lead to rebound heart rate or blood pressure. Patients who cannot take it orally can be given parenteral medication. {(IV) Other preparations} The impact of surgery on liver and kidney function is often more significant than anesthesia, especially factors that affect liver blood flow or (and) abdominal control organ vascular resistance. If it is not a partial resection or surgery that changes liver blood flow (such as portal-caval shunt), these effects are mostly transient. In general, patients with mild to moderate liver function abnormalities should pay attention to the maintenance and improvement of liver function during pre-anesthetic preparation, but it should not become a contraindication to anesthesia and surgery. For patients with severe liver dysfunction (such as advanced liver cirrhosis, severe malnutrition, emaciation, anemia, hypoproteinemia, large amounts of ascites, coagulation disorder, systemic bleeding or pre-encephalopathy of hepatic coma), if surgical treatment cannot improve their liver function, the risk of surgery is extremely high and any elective surgery is not suitable. Surgery is contraindicated in the acute stage of liver disease except for emergencies. Emergency surgery is also very likely to cause complications such as severe coagulation dysfunction during and after the operation, and the prognosis is poor. With the improvement of medical technology, the life expectancy of patients with end-stage renal disease has been extended. Such patients are often accompanied by lesions of other organs and systems, such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, anemia, metabolic and endocrine disorders, etc. Patients with end-stage renal disease should undergo dialysis treatment in a timely manner during the perioperative period to reduce the occurrence of pulmonary edema and coagulation disorders caused by uremia during the perioperative period. Postoperative renal insufficiency is one of the important causes of death in surgical patients during the perioperative period. There are many risk factors that affect perioperative renal function, including: (1) reduced renal reserve before surgery, such as coexisting diabetes, hypertension, and liver dysfunction; (2) factors related to surgery, such as aortic clamping, extracorporeal circulation, prolonged surgery, and massive blood loss; (3) factors that may cause renal damage during anesthesia and surgery, such as hypotension, hypovolemia, and antibiotics. Therefore, the patient's renal function should be correctly assessed before surgery, preoperative preparation and appropriate treatment should be done carefully, and preventive measures should be formulated for risk factors that lead to renal insufficiency to protect renal function. When a pregnancy is complicated by surgical diseases, the safety of the pregnant woman and fetus must be considered when deciding whether to perform surgery and anesthesia. During the first three months of pregnancy, factors such as hypoxia, anesthetics, or infection can easily cause congenital malformations or miscarriage in the fetus, so surgery should be avoided as much as possible, and elective surgery should be postponed until after delivery as much as possible. If it is an emergency surgery, hypoxia and hypotension should be avoided during anesthesia. The 4th to 6th month of pregnancy is generally considered to be the best time for surgical treatment, and if necessary, limited surgery can be performed. Elective surgery (except for minor surgery under local anesthesia) requires routine stomach emptying regardless of the type of anesthesia used. The purpose is to prevent reflux and vomiting during or after surgery, and to avoid accidents such as lung infection or suffocation caused by aspiration. The normal gastric emptying time is $4 to 6$ hours. Emotional excitement, fear, anxiety, or pain and discomfort can significantly slow down gastric emptying. It is generally believed that elective surgery patients, regardless of the type of anesthesia chosen, should fast for at least 6 hours before surgery from easily digestible solid food or non-human milk; and fast for at least 8 hours from fried food, fat-rich or meat-rich food; if the above foods are consumed in excessive amounts, the gastric emptying time can be prolonged, and the fasting time should be appropriately extended. Newborns and infants should abstain from breast milk for at least 4 hours, and easily digestible solid food, non-human milk or infant formula for at least 6 hours. Patients of all ages can drink water 2 hours before surgery, including drinking water, fruit juice (without pulp), soda drinks, tea, and pure coffee, but not alcoholic beverages. Emergency patients should also fully consider gastric emptying. For emergency surgery patients with a full stomach, measures should be taken to avoid aspiration to ensure airway patency and prevent serious lung complications. {II. Pre-anesthetic medication} {(I) Purpose of pre-anesthetic medication} begin{enumerate} item Sedation Reduce the patient's fear, relieve anxiety, calm the mood, and produce necessary amnesia. item Analgesia Reduce pain during preoperative catheterization, local anesthesia, and body movement. item Inhibit the secretion of respiratory glands and prevent the toxic reaction of local anesthetics. item Adjust the autonomic nervous function and eliminate or weaken some adverse nerve reflex activities. end{enumerate} {(II) Commonly used drugs} begin{enumerate} item Analgesics (narcotics) can increase the pain threshold and can synergize with general anesthetics, thereby reducing the dosage of general anesthetics. For patients with severe pain before surgery, the use of analgesics before anesthesia can make the patients quiet and cooperative. The auxiliary use of analgesics during spinal anesthesia can reduce the visceral traction pain of abdominal surgery. Commonly used analgesics include morphine, pethidine and fentanyl, which are generally injected intramuscularly half an hour before anesthesia. item Benzodiazepines have sedative, hypnotic, anxiety-relieving, amnesia, anticonvulsant and central muscle relaxation effects, and also have certain preventive and therapeutic effects on local anesthetic toxicity. Commonly used drugs include diazepam (diazepam, Valium), midazolam (midazolam, dormicum), etc. Midazolam can also produce anterograde amnesia, which is characterized by complete immediate memory, impaired subsequent memory, and no retrograde amnesia. The use of amnestic drugs before surgery has a significant effect on preventing intraoperative awareness. item Barbiturates Mainly inhibit the cerebral cortex, have sedative, hypnotic and anticonvulsant effects, and can prevent the toxic reaction of local anesthetics. Phenobarbital (Luminal) is commonly used. The elderly, weak, shock and hypothyroid patients should use reduced doses; those with a history of allergy to barbiturates should not use them. item Anticholinergics Can block cholinergic receptors on the effectors of postganglionic cholinergic nerves, mainly reducing the secretion of airway mucosa and salivary glands, which is convenient for maintaining airway patency. Atropine also has the effect of inhibiting vagal reflexes and increasing heart rate. However, it is not recommended to use anticholinergics routinely in pre-anesthetic medication, but should be used according to specific circumstances. Adult dose: Atropine $0.5 mathrm{mg}$ or scopolamine $0.3 mathrm{mg}$, injected intramuscularly half an hour before anesthesia. end{enumerate} Penehyclidine hydrochloride (Changtuo Ning), a new drug pioneered in my country, has a stronger central and peripheral anticholinergic effect than atropine, and has obvious selectivity for the $M$ cholinergic receptor subtypes $ left (M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3} right)$, that is, it mainly acts on $M_{1} and M_{3}$ receptors, while the effect on $M_{2}$ receptors is weak or not obvious. Due to this selectivity, it has a central sedative effect in the human body, has no obvious effect on the heart, does not cause increased heart rate, and does not cause adverse reactions such as urinary retention and intestinal dysentery after medication. The blood drug concentration reaches a high level 10 minutes after intramuscular injection, and reaches a peak value in $20 sim 30$ minutes. When used as a pre-anesthetic drug, it is particularly suitable for those who need to avoid increased heart rate (such as thyroid dysfunction and heart disease). The clinically recommended dose is: (1) Adults, $0.5 sim 1 mathrm{mg}$, intramuscular injection; (2) Children, $0.01 sim 0.02 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$, intramuscular injection. 5. $ mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor blockers Cimetidine or ranitidine have strong antihistamine effects. If given orally $60 sim$ 90 minutes before surgery, it can significantly increase the $ mathrm{pH}$ of gastric juice and reduce the volume of gastric juice. This drug can reduce the risk of reflux and aspiration during anesthesia and surgery for patients with acute abdomen and pregnant women who have not yet prepared for fasting. {(III) Medication method} The type, dose, route and time of medication before anesthesia should be determined according to the patient's condition and anesthesia method. Sedatives and hypnotics can be taken orally the night before surgery to eliminate the patient's nervousness and allow them to sleep and rest. Pre-anesthetic medication on the day of surgery is selected according to the anesthesia method as follows: begin{enumerate} item General anesthesia Inject pethidine $50 mathrm{mg}$ and atropine $0.5 mathrm{mg}$ or scopolamine $0.3 mathrm{mg}$ intramuscularly 30 minutes before anesthesia. Morphine $5 sim 8 mathrm{mg}$ and scopolamine $0.3 mathrm{mg}$ are often injected intramuscularly for patients with heart disease. item Local anesthesia For large-scale surgeries, oral diazepam $10 mathrm{mg}$ 2 hours before anesthesia can prevent local anesthetic toxicity. Intramuscular injection of pethidine $50 sim 100 mathrm{mg}$ before surgery can enhance the anesthesia effect. item Spinal anesthesia Oral diazepam $10 mathrm{mg}$ 2 hours before anesthesia; For patients with a wide range of spinal anesthesia blockade, intramuscular atropine $0.5 mathrm{mg}$ may be used as appropriate. end{enumerate} {(IV) Precautions} In order for pre-anesthetic medication to achieve the desired effect, its dosage needs to be appropriately adjusted according to the condition and anesthesia method: (1) For patients with poor general condition, the elderly, the weak, cachexia, shock and hypothyroidism, the dosage of morphine, pethidine, barbiturates and other drugs should be reduced; morphine and pethidine are contraindicated for patients with respiratory insufficiency, increased intramural pressure or pregnant women. (2) For young, strong, emotionally stressed or thyroid dysfunction patients, the dosage of pre-anesthetic medication should be appropriately increased; analgesics should be given to patients with severe wound pain. (3) For patients with tachycardia or thyroid dysfunction, or when the ambient temperature is high, anticholinergic drugs may not be used or should be used less. If they must be used, penehyclidine hydrochloride or scopolamine is preferred. (4) When administering sodium thiopental or halogen-containing inhalation anesthesia, the dose of atropine should be increased because it can reduce vagal nerve tension, has a certain preventive effect on laryngeal spasm caused by vagal nerve excitement during sodium thiopental anesthesia, and can counteract the effect of slowing the heart rate. (5) Children have a low tolerance to morphine, so the dose should be reduced as appropriate. However, due to the vigorous glandular secretion of children, the dose of anticholinergic drugs before general anesthesia should be slightly larger. (6) When multiple pre-anesthetic drugs are administered in combination, the dose should be reduced as appropriate. {Chapter 3 Local Anesthesia}\n",
      "{Section 1 Local Anesthetics} Local anesthetics are a class of drugs that can temporarily and reversibly block the generation and transmission of nerve impulses, causing loss of sensation or (and) movement in the area innervated by the relevant nerves. They are referred to as local anesthetics. The earliest local anesthetic used was cocaine, an alkaloid extracted from coca leaves in South America. In 1884, Koller first used cocaine as a surface anesthetic in ophthalmic surgery. In 1905, Einhorn synthesized procaine, and in 1943, Lofgren and Lundguist synthesized lidocaine, an amide local anesthetic. At present, there are more than ten types of local anesthetics commonly used in clinical practice. {I. Classification and physicochemical properties} {(I) Classification} begin{enumerate} item Classification by chemical structure Typical local anesthetics have similar chemical structures of aromatic group-intermediate chain-amine group. The intermediate chain can usually be divided into ester chain and amide chain. Therefore, according to the difference of the intermediate chain, local anesthetics can be divided into ester local anesthetics (such as procaine) and amide local anesthetics (such as lidocaine), and their structures are shown in Figure 3-1. The aromatic group is a lipophilic group. The aromatic group of ester local anesthetics is benzylamine, and the aromatic group of amide local anesthetics is aniline; the amine group is a hydrophilic group. The amine group of most local anesthetics is tertiary amine, and a few are secondary amines. Commonly used ester local anesthetics include: procaine, chloroprocaine and tetracaine. Commonly used amide local anesthetics include: lidocaine, bupivacaine and ropivacaine, etc. end{enumerate} includegraphics{smile-lyefuty13x63nmxrq25.png} Figure 3-1 Structure of local anesthetics begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Classification by duration of action According to the duration of action of local anesthetics in clinical practice, they are classified as follows: procaine and chloroprocaine are short-acting local anesthetics; lidocaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine are medium-acting local anesthetics; bupivacaine, tetracaine, ropivacaine and etidocaine are long-acting local anesthetics. end{enumerate} {(II) Physicochemical properties} The physicochemical properties and anesthetic effects of local anesthetics depend on their molecular structure, which is closely related to the substituents on the aromatic group, the type of intermediate chain and the alkyl group on the amine group (Table 3-1). begin{enumerate} item Lipophilicity and hydrophilicity Due to the characteristics of the molecular structure of local anesthetics, local anesthetics are both lipophilic and hydrophilic. Its hydrophilicity is conducive to the transport of local anesthetics to the vicinity of the nerve membrane; its lipophilicity is conducive to the permeation of local anesthetics through the cell membrane to exert the effect of nerve blocking, so it is also an important factor in determining the performance of local anesthetics. The hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of local anesthetics are related to the number of carbon chains on the aromatic or amine groups in the local anesthetic molecules: the longer the carbon chain, the higher its lipophilicity, the stronger the effect, the longer the duration, but the toxicity also increases accordingly. Table 3-1 Physical and chemical properties of commonly used local anesthetics begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} hline Common name & Chemical structure & Lipid solubility & $ operatorname{pKa} left(25^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$ & Protein binding rate (%) hline Procaine & $ mathrm{OOC}$ & + & 8. 9 & 6 hline Tetracaine & $- mathrm{COC}$ & ++++ & 8. 2 & 76 hline Lidocaine & & ++ & 7. 8 & 70 hline Bupivacaine & & ++++ & 8.1 & 95 hline Ropivacaine & & ++++ & 8.1 & 94 hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Dissociation constant ( $ mathrm{pKa}$ ) Most synthetic local anesthetics are crystalline powders, which are difficult to dissolve in water and are chemically unstable when exposed to air. All local anesthetics are weakly alkaline and easily combine with acids to form salts. Such salts are easily soluble in water and have stable chemical properties. Therefore, most local anesthetics commonly used in clinical practice are hydrochlorides, such as lidocaine hydrochloride. In aqueous solution, the complex salt will dissociate into an uncharged base $( mathrm{B})$ and a charged cation $ left( mathrm{BH}^{+} right)$, as shown in the following reaction formula. end{enumerate} [ mathrm{BH}^{+} rightleftarrows mathrm{B}+ mathrm{H}^{+} ] (cation)(base) In equilibrium, the above dissociation constant: [ mathrm{Ka}= frac{ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right][ text {base }]}{[ text {cation }]} ] Ka is generally expressed as its negative logarithm $ mathrm{pKa}$, so: [ mathrm{pKa}= mathrm{pH}- log frac{ text { [base] }}{[ text {cation }]} ] The $ mathrm{pH}$ when the concentrations of base and cation in the solution are equal by acid-base titration is the $ mathrm{pKa}$ of the drug. Different local anesthetics have their own fixed $ mathrm{pKa}$ values. When local anesthetics enter the tissue, due to the $ mathrm{pH}$ of the tissue fluid approaching 7.4, the local anesthetics dissociate, the bases bind to the proteins of the tissue or plasma, and temporarily lose their pharmacological activity. Therefore, the larger the $ mathrm{pKa}$ of the local anesthetic, the more ions there are, the fewer bases there are, the worse its diffusion performance is, the less likely it is to penetrate the nerve sheath and membrane, and the longer it takes to take effect. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Lipid solubility is an important factor in determining the anesthetic intensity of local anesthetics. The greater the lipid solubility, the stronger the anesthetic performance. Since the nerve cell membrane is basically a lipoprotein layer, containing $90%$ of lipids and $10%$ of proteins. Therefore, local anesthetics with high lipid solubility are easier to penetrate the nerve cell membrane and are easier to exert the blocking effect of local anesthetics. item Protein binding rate The plasma protein binding rate of local anesthetics is closely related to the duration of action. The higher the binding rate, the longer the duration of action. Because local anesthetics can bind to protein receptors in sodium channels and block nerve conduction function. The tighter the binding to the receptor, the longer the duration of action. Similarly, the degree of binding of local anesthetics to membrane proteins is also closely related to their protein binding rate. end{enumerate} {II. Mechanism of Action} Local anesthetics can act on any part of the nervous system and various nerve fibers, affecting the sensation and movement of the area they control, but different types of nerve fibers have different sensitivities to local anesthetics. The effect of local anesthetics is related to the diameter of nerve cells or nerve fibers and the anatomical characteristics of nerve tissue. The general rule is that nerve fiber endings, ganglia and synapses in the central nervous system are most sensitive to local anesthetics, and thin nerve fibers are easier to block than thick nerve fibers. It can have an effect on unmyelinated sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic fibers at low concentrations; it requires high concentrations to have an effect on sheathed sensory and motor nerve fibers. When the mixed nerve is acted upon, the first thing that disappears is the persistent dull pain (such as tenderness), followed by the transient sharp pain, followed by the disappearance of the cold sensation, the temperature sensation, the touch sensation, and the pressure sensation, and finally the motor paralysis. The recovery of nerve impulse conduction is carried out in the opposite order. Local anesthetics mainly act on the nerve cell membrane. Under normal circumstances, the depolarization of the nerve cell membrane depends on the influx of sodium ions. Local anesthetics can block the voltage-gated sodium channels on the nerve cell membrane and inhibit the influx of sodium, thereby preventing the generation of action potentials and the conduction of nerve impulses, and producing a local anesthetic effect. The blocking effect of local anesthetics on sodium channels is related to the state of sodium channels. The voltage-gated sodium channels include three states: resting state, activated state, and inactivated state. Compared with the resting state, the affinity of local anesthetics to the activated and inactivated sodium channels is significantly enhanced. {III. Clinical Pharmacology} In clinical use, local anesthetics are generally injected around the nerves to be blocked. Local anesthetics should not be injected directly into the nerves to avoid nerve damage and compression of the nerve supplying blood vessels. Therefore, the plasma concentration and pharmacological effects of local anesthetics in clinical practice are not only related to the anatomical structure of the injection site, but also depend on the injection dose of the drug, the drug absorption rate at the injection site, the tissue distribution rate and the biotransformation clearance rate, as well as patient-related factors including age, cardiovascular system status, liver function, etc. {(I) Pharmacokinetics} begin{enumerate} item Absorption The systemic absorption of local anesthetics depends on the injection site, dose, volume, local tissue blood perfusion, whether vasoconstrictors are used as an adjuvant, and the pharmacological properties of the drug itself. The peak blood concentration is proportional to the single injection dose. In order to avoid local anesthetic poisoning caused by excessive peak blood concentration, a single dose limit is set for each local anesthetic. The blood concentration of the drug was measured and compared after administration by different routes. It was found that when local anesthetics were administered extravascularly, the blood concentration was in the following descending order: intratracheal injection>intercostal nerve block>sacral canal block>paracervical injection>epidural space block>brachial plexus block>sciatic-femoral nerve block>subcutaneous injection. This is of great clinical significance because the same dose of local anesthetic may have different effects on patients due to different sites of use. For example, when $400 mathrm{mg}$ lidocaine (without epinephrine) is used for intercostal nerve block, its average peak blood concentration can reach $7 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{ml}$, which is enough to cause central nervous system toxicity symptoms in some patients. The same dose of lidocaine used for brachial plexus block produces a maximum blood concentration of $3 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{ml}$, which rarely causes toxic reactions. When the local anesthetic solution is injected into a blood-rich area, it is absorbed faster and more strongly. For example, when a paracervical block is performed on a pregnant woman in labor, the vascular plexus around the uterus is filled, which may accelerate the absorption of local anesthetics and cause toxic reactions in the fetus. end{enumerate} Vasoconstrictors are often added to local anesthetic solutions. Epinephrine $(5 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{ml})$ at a ratio of $1:200000$ is commonly used. Phenylephrine can also be used. Epinephrine can cause local vasoconstriction of the injection site, thereby reducing the absorption of drugs through blood vessels at the injection site, improving the block effect, prolonging the duration of action of local anesthetics, and reducing the occurrence of toxic reactions. Vasoconstrictors have little effect on long-acting local anesthetics (such as bupivacaine and etidocaine). Vasoconstrictors are not suitable for patients with cardiovascular disease or thyroid dysfunction. Epinephrine is also contraindicated when performing local blocks on fingers, toes, or penis. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Distribution Local anesthetics are absorbed from the injection site through the capillaries and distributed to various organs. The uptake of local anesthetics by various organs determines the distribution of the drug. After absorbing into the human blood, local anesthetics are first distributed to the lungs, where some are taken up by the lung tissue. They are then quickly distributed to organs with good blood perfusion, such as the heart, brain, ligaments, and kidneys, and then distributed more slowly to muscles, fat, and skin with poor perfusion. The relative concentrations of local anesthetics in different tissues vary, with highly perfused organs containing higher concentrations of local anesthetics than poorly perfused organs. Although skeletal muscle has no special affinity for local anesthetics, the majority of the injected dose of local anesthetics is distributed to skeletal muscle due to the large amount of skeletal muscle in the body. item Biotransformation and elimination The metabolic pathways and rates of local anesthetics are related to their chemical structure. Ester local anesthetics are mainly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase, and water-soluble metabolites are excreted through the kidneys. Different drugs have different metabolic rates. Amide local anesthetics are mainly metabolized by mixed function oxidase and amidase in liver microsomes. The metabolic process is relatively complex and the metabolic rate is much lower than the hydrolysis of ester local anesthetics. The metabolic rate of amide local anesthetics in the liver varies. The metabolites are mainly excreted through the kidneys, and about $5%$ of the drug is excreted in the urine as the original form. A small part of lidocaine can also be excreted through bile. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Effects on organs throughout the body} begin{enumerate} item Effects on the central nervous system Local anesthetics often enter the brain through the bloodstream. Intravenous administration of lidocaine $(1.5 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg})$ can reduce cerebral blood flow and reduce the increase in intracranial pressure caused by endotracheal intubation, thereby reducing the occurrence of cerebral complications. The effect of local anesthetics on the central nervous system depends on the concentration of local anesthetics in the blood. Low concentrations (such as procaine) have inhibitory, analgesic, and anticonvulsant effects, while high concentrations can induce convulsions. Convulsions induced by local anesthetics are considered to be toxic reactions of local anesthetics. item Effects on the cardiovascular system Local anesthetics have direct effects on the heart and peripheral blood vessels, and can indirectly affect the function of the circulatory system by blocking the efferent fibers of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves. The effect of local anesthetics on cardiac function is mainly to hinder the sodium transfer during depolarization, reduce myocardial excitability, slow repolarization, and prolong the refractory period. The atria, atrioventricular node, intraventricular conduction and myocardial contractility are all inhibited in a dose-related manner. The inhibition of myocardial contractility is related to the blocking effect of local anesthetics. Bupivacaine and tetracaine have stronger inhibitory effects on the heart than lidocaine and procaine. Except for cocaine, all local anesthetics can relax vascular smooth muscle, cause a certain degree of arteriolar dilation, and reduce blood pressure. item Effects on the respiratory system Lidocaine inhibits the body's ventilatory response to hypoxia. Due to the blockade of the phrenic nerve and intercostal nerves or the direct action of local anesthetics on the medullary respiratory center, respiratory arrest can occur. Local anesthetics can relax bronchial smooth muscle. Intravenous administration of lidocaine $(1.5 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg})$ can inhibit the bronchial contraction reflex caused by endotracheal intubation. However, for patients with airway hyperresponsiveness, the administration of lidocaine aerosol may induce bronchospasm due to direct stimulation. end{enumerate} {Fourth, factors affecting the pharmacological action of local anesthetics} begin{enumerate} item Drug dosage The dosage of local anesthetics can be increased by increasing the volume or concentration of local anesthetics, thereby shortening the onset time of the drug and prolonging the duration of action. item Injection site Different injection sites can affect the diffusion rate and vascular absorption rate of local anesthetics. Intrathecal and subcutaneous injections of local anesthetics have the fastest onset of action, and brachial plexus block has the longest onset of action. In the subarachnoid space block, the spinal nerves are not surrounded by an outer sheath, so the onset of action is rapid. item Added drugs The effect of adding epinephrine to local anesthetics on the block duration depends on the type of local anesthetic and the injection site. Epinephrine can prolong the duration of action of local infiltration anesthesia and nerve blocks with short-acting local anesthetics (such as lidocaine); but it cannot prolong the motor nerve block duration of bupivacaine or etidocaine during epidural block. Adding $ alpha_{2}$ receptor agonists to intrathecal local anesthetics can shorten the onset of sensory blockade and prolong the duration of motor and sensory blockade. item Age Patients of different ages can affect the clearance of local anesthetics. For example, after intravenous injection of lidocaine in healthy volunteers aged 22 to 26, its half-life averaged 80 minutes, while the half-life of healthy volunteers aged $61 to 71$ was extended to 138 minutes. Because the liver enzyme system of newborns is not yet mature, the elimination half-life of lidocaine and bupivacaine can be prolonged. item Organ function Patients with severe liver damage, severe anemia or malnutrition may have low plasma pseudocholinesterase levels, which may reduce the hydrolysis and metabolism rate of ester local anesthetics and make toxic reactions more likely to occur. Liver function can also affect the degradation rate of amide local anesthetics. Compared with patients with normal liver function, patients with decreased liver blood flow or impaired liver function have increased levels of amide local anesthetics in the blood and prolonged half-life. In patients with congestive heart failure, the clearance rate of lidocaine is also significantly delayed. item 娲孕 The anesthesia plane and depth of epidural block and spinal anesthesia in pregnant women are higher than those in non-pregnant women. In addition to mechanical factors (epidural vein dilation reduces the epidural space and subarachnoid hydrazone), changes in hormone levels during pregnancy can enhance sensitivity to local anesthetics. Therefore, pregnant patients should appropriately reduce the dosage of local anesthetics. end{enumerate} {V. Toxic reactions of local anesthetics} Local anesthetics can block the body's voltage-gated sodium channels and affect the conduction of action potentials. Therefore, local anesthetics have systemic toxic effects. When the concentration of local anesthetics in the blood exceeds a certain threshold, systemic toxic reactions of local anesthetics will occur, mainly involving the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and in severe cases, it can be fatal. Common causes of systemic toxic reactions include: excessive dosage or concentration of local anesthetics, accidental injection of drugs into blood vessels, and reduced patient tolerance. The degree of toxic reaction is directly related to the blood drug concentration and is proportional to the intensity of the local anesthetic. It is generally believed that when local anesthetics are mixed, the toxic effects are cumulative. {(I) Central nervous system toxicity} The central nervous system is more sensitive to local anesthetics than the cardiovascular system. For awake patients, central nervous system symptoms are often a precursor to local anesthetic toxicity. Initial symptoms include dizziness and numbness around the mouth, and then the patient will experience tinnitus and blurred vision (difficulty in focusing or nystagmus), multilingualism, chills, panic and disorientation. If it continues to develop, loss of consciousness and coma may occur, and facial muscles and distal limbs will tremble, muscle twitching, and eventually tonic-clonic convulsions will occur. If the local anesthetic is injected into the blood in large doses and quickly, the central nervous system will quickly develop a state of depression, respiratory and circulatory depression, and even cardiac arrest. Respiratory or metabolic acidosis can increase the risk of central nervous system toxicity caused by local anesthetics. $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ increases cerebral blood flow, local anesthetics enter the brain more quickly, and can also lower the brain's seizure threshold; hypercapnia and (or) acidosis can reduce the plasma protein binding rate of local anesthetics, which will increase the amount of drugs diffusing into the brain tissue. Seizures can cause hypoventilation and respiratory and metabolic acidosis, which further aggravate central nervous system toxicity. In addition, high fever will also increase the brain's sensitivity to local anesthetics. {(II) Cardiovascular system toxicity} The blood concentration of most local anesthetics that produce cardiovascular system toxicity is more than 3 times the blood concentration when convulsions occur, but bupivacaine and etidocaine are exceptions, in which central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity occur almost simultaneously. The early stage of cardiovascular system toxicity is manifested by tachycardia and increased blood pressure indirectly caused by central nervous system excitement; in the late stage, the direct effect of local anesthetics weakens myocardial contractility and reduces cardiac output, causing arrhythmias; relaxes vascular smooth muscle, dilates arterioles, and reduces blood pressure. When the blood drug concentration is extremely high, there may be widespread dilation of peripheral blood vessels, heart block, slow heart rate, and even cardiac arrest. In animal experiments, bupivacaine can cause serious arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation (abbreviated as \"VF\"), while lidocaine, tetracaine, and mepivacaine rarely cause ventricular arrhythmias. Compared with other local anesthetics, the success rate of cardiac resuscitation for cardiovascular failure caused by bupivacaine is low. Pregnant patients are more sensitive to the cardiovascular toxicity of bupivacaine, so $0.75%$ bupivacaine is not recommended in obstetric anesthesia in the United States. Acidosis and hypoxia can also enhance the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine. {(III) Allergic reaction} Local anesthetic allergic reaction refers to the symptoms of skin erythema, urticaria, throat edema, bronchospasm, angioedema, and even shock after using a small amount of local anesthetic, which endangers the patient's life safety. Allergic reaction is an antigen-antibody reaction that causes mast cells to release active substances such as histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine, causing the body to react rapidly and severely with the whole body. True allergic reaction to local anesthetics is not common. In clinical practice, toxic reactions or adverse reactions to adrenaline added to local anesthetics are often mistaken for allergic reactions. Compared with amide local anesthetics, allergic reactions to ester local anesthetics are more common. Local anesthetics of the same type may have cross-allergic reactions due to their similar structures. Therefore, patients who are allergic to procaine should avoid using tetracaine or chloroprocaine. {(IV) Prevention and treatment of toxic reactions} begin{enumerate} item Prevention Preventive measures include: (1) Pay attention to pre-anesthetic preparation: Conduct a full preoperative assessment of the patient. Patients with hypoproteinemia are prone to toxic reactions to local anesthetics. Prepare rescue equipment and drugs. (2) Control the dose of local anesthetic and pay attention to the operation technique: There is currently no completely reliable method to determine accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetics. Therefore, in addition to syringe withdrawal, local anesthetics can be used with long intervals and gradually increasing doses, observing signs of toxic reactions, and maintaining communication with patients to detect toxic reaction symptoms in a timely manner. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Treatment Treatment measures include: (1) General treatment: After the symptoms and signs of local anesthetic poisoning are found, the injection of local anesthetics should be stopped immediately, and the airway should be maintained and oxygen should be given to prevent or correct hypoxia and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation. (2) Mild toxic reactions are mostly transient, and oxygen inhalation can significantly improve the patient's subjective feeling; for those who are nervous or irritable, giving an appropriate amount of benzodiazepines can control the symptoms. (3) Treatment of convulsions: When convulsions or seizures occur, benzodiazepines are the first choice for intravenous medication. Propofol or thiopental sodium can also be used, but propofol is not recommended when the patient is hemodynamically unstable. If seizures continue after the use of benzodiazepines, a small dose of succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants can be used. If cardiac arrest occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be performed immediately, and it is recommended that the initial dose of epinephrine be a small dose (adults $10 sim 100 mu mathrm{g}$ each time); vasopressin is not recommended, and the use of berthium channel blockers and $ beta$ receptor antagonists should be avoided; when ventricular arrhythmias occur, amiodarone is recommended, and lidocaine is not recommended. At present, the effect of using fat emulsions to treat local anesthetic poisoning is still controversial. When using $20%$ fat emulsion for treatment, the loading dose is $1.5 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$, which lasts for 1 minute, and the maintenance dose is $0.25 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, which is continuously infused until the circulation is stable for 10 minutes. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Regional Anesthesia} Regional anesthesia refers to an anesthetic method in which local anesthetics are used to temporarily block nerve conduction in a certain area of ​​the body while the patient is conscious. When the sensory nerves are blocked, local pain and sensation are inhibited or eliminated; when the motor nerves are blocked at the same time, muscle movement is weakened or completely relaxed. This block is temporary and completely reversible. Local anesthesia in a narrow sense includes surface anesthesia, local infiltration anesthesia, regional block, intravenous local anesthesia and nerve block. Local anesthesia in a broad sense also includes spinal anesthesia. {I. Surface anesthesia} Surface anesthesia is a method of contacting a local anesthetic with a strong permeability with the surface of the local mucosa, allowing it to penetrate the mucosa and block the superficial nerve endings under the mucosa to produce painlessness. It is mostly used for superficial surgery or endoscopic examinations in the eyes, nasal cavity, throat, trachea, urethra, etc. A variety of local anesthetics can be used for surface anesthesia, such as lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine and prilocaine, which can be made into solutions, emulsions, soft bends, and aerosols, and can be used alone or in combination with other drugs on the skin, mucosa, oropharynx, trachea, rectum, etc. Atropine can be given intravenously before surface anesthesia to dry the mucosa and avoid secretions that hinder the contact between the local anesthetic and the mucosa. The mucosa of different parts absorbs local anesthetics at different rates. When aerosols are used in the trachea and bronchi, local anesthetics are absorbed fastest. When high concentrations and large doses of local anesthetics are applied to large areas of mucosa, toxic reactions are prone to occur, and the dosage should be strictly controlled during use.\n",
      "{2. Local infiltration anesthesia} Local anesthetics are injected into the tissue of the surgical area along the surgical incision in layers to block the nerve endings in the tissue. This is called local infiltration anesthesia. During the operation, the needle is inserted at one end of the planned surgical incision, and the bevel of the needle is close to the skin. After entering the skin, the local anesthetic solution is injected to form a chalazion-like skin mound. From then on, the skin mound continues to move forward and infiltrates the entire length of the incision. Then, the local anesthetic is injected layer by layer into the subcutaneous tissue. There are many nerve endings distributed on the membrane surface, under the fascia and periosteum, so the amount of local anesthetic can be appropriately increased. The local anesthetic solution injected into the tissue needs to have a certain volume so that it can form tension infiltration in the tissue and have extensive contact with the nerve endings to enhance the anesthetic effect. Local infiltration anesthesia is not suitable for infected and cancerous areas. Different concentrations of local anesthetics can be selected according to needs; adding an appropriate amount of adrenaline to the solution can prolong the duration of local anesthetics; when the infiltration area is large, in order to prevent the toxic reaction of local anesthetics, the concentration of local anesthetics can be reduced to avoid exceeding the limit of dosage. Commonly used local anesthetics for local infiltration anesthesia are shown in Table 3-2. Table 3-2 Commonly used local anesthetics for local infiltration anesthesia begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline & multirow[b]{2}{*}{Concentration (%)} & multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Ordinary solution} & multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Solution containing epinephrine} hline & & begin{tabular}{c} Maximum dose (mg)$ cdot$ end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{c} Duration (min) end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{c} Maximum dose (mg)$ cdot$ end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{c} Duration (min) end{tabular} hline multicolumn{6}{|l|}{Short-acting} hline Prilocaine & $0.5 sim 1.0$ & 800 & $15 sim 30$ & 1000 & $30 sim 60$ hline Nabucaine & $1.0 sim 2.0$ & 800 & $15 sim 30$ & 1000 & $30 sim 90$ hline multicolumn{6}{|l|}{medium time} hline Lidocaine & $0.5 sim 1.0$ & 400 & $30 sim 60$ & 500 & $120 sim 360$ hline Mepivacaine & $0.5 sim 1.0$ & 300 & $45 sim 90$ & 500 & $120 sim 360$ hline Prilocaine & $0.5 sim 1.0$ & 500 & $30 sim 90$ & 600 & $120 sim 360$ hline multicolumn{6}{|l|}{Long-acting} hline Bupivacaine & $0.25 sim 0.5$ & 150 & $120 sim 240$ & 225 & $180 sim 420$ hline Ropivacaine & $0.1 sim 1.0$ & 200 & $120 sim 360$ & 225 & $180 sim 420$ hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{itemize} item The maximum dose is based on an adult weighing $70 mathrm{~kg}$ end{itemize} {3. Regional block} Injecting local anesthetics around the surgical area, around it and at its base, temporarily blocking the conduction of nerve fibers entering the surgical area is called regional block. The injection can be made around the tissue to be removed (such as small tumors, tumor tissue, etc.), or around the base of the suspensory limbs (tongue, penis or pedunculated tumors). The key points of regional block are the same as those of local infiltration anesthesia, and its main advantage is to avoid puncturing pathological tissue. {IV. Intravenous regional anesthesia} Intravenous regional anesthesia refers to the placement of a tourniquet at the proximal end of the limb, and the injection of local anesthetics from the distal end of the limb. The local anesthetic diffuses from the peripheral vascular bed to the accompanying nerves to block the limb below the tourniquet. It is mainly used for upper or lower limb surgery in adults, and the operation time generally does not exceed 45 minutes. Patients with limb ischemic vascular disease should not use this method. The vein is opened at the distal end of the limb on the surgical side, and the vein on the non-surgical side should also be opened for intravenous infusion and application of other drugs. Place two tourniquets at the proximal end of the affected limb, raise the affected limb and use an elastic bandage to expel blood, then inflate the proximal tourniquet to about $100 mathrm{mmHg}$ higher than the arterial pressure, preferably without touching the arterial pulse at the distal end. After loosening the tourniquet, slowly inject local anesthetic into the vein (injection time>90 seconds), usually after 5 minutes, a good anesthetic effect can be produced. When the patient complains of tourniquet pain, the distal tourniquet can be inflated first, and then the proximal tourniquet can be released. The patient can tolerate it for another 15 to 20 minutes. Commonly used local anesthetics are lidocaine, $0.5%$ lidocaine solution $3 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ (total $<50 mathrm{ml}$) for upper limb surgery; $0.25%$ lidocaine $50 sim 100 mathrm{ml}$ for lower limb surgery. In order to prevent the occurrence of toxic reactions of local anesthetics, the pressure gauge should be closely observed after the tourniquet is inflated to prevent air leakage; if the operation time is very short, the tourniquet can be slowly loosened $15-20$ minutes after the injection of the drug to avoid a large amount of local anesthetic entering the blood circulation after the tourniquet is loosened. {Chapter 3 Local Anesthesia} {Section 3 Nerve Block} {I. Overview} {$(I)$ Concept} Nerve block refers to the method of injecting local anesthetics near the peripheral nerve trunk (plexus) to temporarily block the conduction of nerve impulses and make the area controlled by the nerve achieve painless surgery. Because the nerve trunk (plexus) is mixed, the blocked area not only blocks the sensory nerves, but also the motor nerves and autonomic nerves to varying degrees. Like all other anesthesia methods, nerve block requires a preoperative visit to the patient and a signed informed consent form for anesthesia. During nerve block, the patient must be monitored, oxygen supply, resuscitation equipment and rescue drugs must be prepared. {(II) Indications and contraindications} The indications for nerve block mainly depend on the scope of surgery, operation time, patient's mental state and cooperation. As long as the surgical site is limited to the range of one or some nerve trunks (plexuses) and the block time can meet the needs of the surgery, nerve block anesthesia can be performed. Children or patients with mental illness and other uncooperative patients can undergo nerve block under basic anesthesia or after general anesthesia. Patients with abnormal coagulation function, infection at the puncture site, tumors, severe deformity and allergy to local anesthetics are contraindications for nerve block. {(III) Nerve localization methods} begin{enumerate} item Abnormal sensation localization When the puncture needle directly touches the nerve, abnormal sensation may occur in the area it controls. At this time, injection of local anesthetics can achieve satisfactory anesthetic effect. However, sometimes even if abnormal sensation occurs during puncture, the anesthetic effect is not necessarily perfect; due to the location of the nerve distribution, the patient's state and other reasons, it may not be possible to induce abnormal sensation. At this time, it cannot be completely relied on for positioning. item Positioning of nerve stimulator The principle of nerve stimulator is to use electric stimulator to generate pulse current and transmit it to insulated puncture needle. When the needle tip approaches the mixed nerve, it will cause the motor nerve in the mixed nerve to depolarize and cause the muscle it controls to twitch. In this way, it can be positioned by muscle twitch reaction. Usually, the positive electrode of the stimulator is connected to the patient's skin through the surface electrode, and the negative electrode is connected to the puncture needle. The initial current is set to $1 sim 1.5 mathrm{~mA}$; gradually push the needle tip toward the direction of the nerve to be blocked until the muscle contraction is induced; then adjust the current to less than $0.5 mathrm{~mA}$. If there is still a contraction reaction, inject local anesthetic. After injecting 1 2ml of local anesthetic, this contraction reaction can quickly subside. The advantages of this method are accurate positioning, improved success rate of nerve block, and convenient teaching. However, it requires special equipment and is expensive. item Ultrasound positioning The ultrasound probe is used to scan the nerve area, so that the nerve is imaged in the axial plane. The puncture needle is inserted laterally from the longitudinal axis of the probe and enters the tissue along the direction of the ultrasound beam. Under the guidance of ultrasound imaging, the direction of the puncture needle is adjusted to reach the nerve block point. When the needle tip approaches the nerve and penetrates the high-echo fiber sheath around the nerve, local anesthetic is injected. Ultrasound imaging positioning technology can intuitively understand the position of the muscles, nerves and blood vessels at the puncture site, guide the puncture needle to be inserted accurately, thereby improving the accuracy of positioning and avoiding damage to nerves and blood vessels; at the same time, the diffusion law of local anesthetic after injection can also be observed. If the liquid is closely distributed around the nerve, it means that the puncture position is appropriate, thereby reducing the use of material and improving the safety of puncture. end{enumerate} {II. Cervical nerve block} {(I) Anatomy} The cervical nerve plexus (abbreviated as \"cervical plexus\") is composed of the cervical $ ldots 4$ spinal nerves $ left ( mathrm{C}_{1} sim mathrm{C}_{4} right.$ ), $ mathrm{C}_{1}$ is mainly a motor nerve, $ mathrm{C}_{2} sim mathrm{C}_{4}$ are mixed nerves. The cervical nerve plexus is divided into the superficial plexus and the deep plexus, which respectively control the corresponding skin and muscle tissues of the neck. The superficial plexus is located at the midpoint of the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and is radially distributed to the superficial skin tissues of the submandibular, clavicular, neck and occipital regions. Towards are the anterior cervical nerves, downwards are the supraclavicular nerves, upwards and backwards are the greater auricular nerves, and towards are the lesser occipital nerves. The deep plexus mainly controls the deep tissues of the front and sides of the neck. {(II) Choice of local anesthetic} The collar has rich blood supply, and the duration of the neck block is shorter than that of other parts of the nerve block. Therefore, within the safe dose range of local anesthetics, one local anesthetic or a mixture of two local anesthetics can be selected. Commonly used in clinical practice: 1% 1.5% lidocaine, 0.15% $0.2%$ tetracaine, $0.25% sim 0.5%$ bupivacaine and $0.25% sim 0.5%$ ropivacaine, or $1%$ lidocaine and $0.15%$ tetracaine mixture, $1%$ lidocaine and $0.25%$ bupivacaine mixture, etc. {(III) Clinical application and methods} Cervical plexus block is mostly used for cervical lymph node resection, thyroidectomy, tracheotomy and carotid endarterectomy, etc. When cervical plexus block is used for unilateral carotid endarterectomy, the patient can remain awake during the operation, which is conducive to timely understanding of the patient's changes in consciousness. begin{enumerate} item Superficial cervical plexus block The puncture point is located at the midpoint of the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. After routine disinfection, a $22 mathrm{G}$ puncture needle is inserted vertically into the skin and the needle is slowly inserted; when the paper-like feeling of falling through the puncture is encountered, it indicates that the needle tip has passed through the platysma muscle. Inject local anesthetic into the platysma muscle and subcutaneously; it can also be infiltrated on the surface of the platysma muscle to the transverse process, clavicle and anterior neck to block the branches of the superficial cervical plexus. Generally, the amount of drug on each side is about $10 mathrm{ml}$ (Figure 3-2). end{enumerate} {2. Deep cervical plexus block} (1) Anterior cervical block: It is to block the $ mathrm{C}_{2} sim mathrm{C}_{4}$ spinal nerves that pass through the intervertebral foramen. The traditional method uses the 3-point method, but it is rarely used now because of many complications. The modified method is currently used, that is, 8-10ml of local anesthetic is injected into the $ mathrm{C}_{4}$ transverse process. The local anesthetic diffuses toward the head and can block the $ mathrm{C}_{2} and mathrm{C}_{3}$ nerves. (2) Interscalene block: Pierce the skin horizontally and vertically at the top (tip) of the interscalene groove between the anterior scalene muscle and the middle scalene muscle, then move slightly backward and downward. When there is a strange sensation or the transverse process is touched, inject the local anesthetic. The liquid spreads along the scalene gap and the deep side of the prevertebral fascia, and the root of the cervical plexus is blocked. When injecting the drug, compressing the distal end or placing the patient in a head-down position will help the local anesthetic spread upward.\n",
      "{(IV) Complications of cervical plexus block} Complications are more common in deep cervical plexus block, with a low incidence rate. Common complications include: (1) Toxicity of local anesthetics: mostly caused by the puncture needle accidentally entering the blood vessel, so suction should be performed before each injection; (2) Recurrent laryngeal nerve block: can cause hoarseness or loss of voice in patients, especially when bilateral block is performed; (3) Phrenic nerve block: the phrenic nerve is often affected, and dyspnea and chest tightness may occur when both sides are affected. Bilateral deep cervical plexus block should be performed with caution; (4) Horner's syndrome: due to the blockade of the cervical sympathetic nerves, symptoms such as ptosis of the ipsilateral eyelid, miosis, conjunctival congestion, nasal congestion, and slightly red face occur; (5) High epidural block or total spinal anesthesia: mainly caused by the puncture needle entering the epidural space or subarachnoid space. {III. Brachial nerve from the vagina} {(I) Anatomy} The brachial plexus is composed of the anterior rami of the cervical ${ }_{5-8} left( mathrm{C}_{5} sim mathrm{C}_{8} right)$ and thoracic $丨_{1} left( mathrm{~T}_{1} right)$ spinal nerves, and sometimes also receives small branches from the anterior rami of the cervical ${ }_{4} left( mathrm{C}_{4} right)$ and thoracic $)_{2} left( mathrm{~T}_{2} right)$ spinal nerves, which mainly control the entire hand and arm movement and most of the sensation (Figure 3-3). The spinal nerves that make up the brachial plexus are divided into upper, middle and lower trunks in the intermuscular groove above the clavicle after exiting the intervertebral foramen. The upper trunk is composed of the anterior branches of $ mathrm{C}_{5} sim mathrm{C}_{6}$, the middle trunk is composed of the anterior branches of $ mathrm{C}_{7}$, and the lower trunk is composed of the anterior branches of $ mathrm{C}_{8}$ and $ mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $ mathrm{T}_{2}$ spinal nerves. After passing through the intermuscular groove, the three nerve trunks pass along the upper edge of the first rib in the posterior and superior part of the subclavian artery. At the outer edge of the first rib behind the clavicle, each nerve trunk is divided into anterior and posterior branches, and enters the axilla behind the middle part of the clavicle. Each femoral nerve is reassembled into three bundles in the axilla. The three posterior bundles are combined into the posterior bundle behind the axillary artery, which continues into the axillary nerve and radial nerve; the anterior bundles of the upper and middle trunks are combined into the lateral bundle on the outside of the axillary artery, which continues into the musculocutaneous nerve and the lateral head of the median nerve; the anterior bundle of the lower trunk extends into the medial bundle, which continues into the ulnar nerve, the medial forearm cutaneous nerve, the medial brachial cutaneous nerve and the medial head of the median nerve. The prevertebral fascia covering the anterior and middle scalene muscles fuses outward and wraps around the brachial plexus to form a fascial sheath, which extends from the intervertebral foramen to the upper part of the upper arm and is the anatomical basis of brachial plexus block. {(II) Selection of local anesthetics} Brachial nerve block drugs require a large volume (20-40ml) to facilitate drug diffusion in the sheath, and the concentration does not need to be too high. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-053} end{center} Figure 3-3 Schematic diagram of brachial plexus anatomy Choose one local anesthetic or a mixture of two local anesthetics. 1% 1.5% lidocaine can be used for 24-hour surgery; if the surgery time is longer, $0.25% sim 0.5%$ bupivacaine or ropivacaine can be used. {(III) Operation method and clinical application} Injecting local anesthetics from any position of the fascial sheath covering the brachial plexus can diffuse and block the $ mathrm{C}_{5} sim mathrm{T}_{1}$ nerve root, but the degree of nerve block varies with the injection site. In clinical practice, different routes are often selected for brachial plexus block according to surgical needs. Commonly used block routes are interscalene block, axillary block and supraclavicular block. begin{enumerate} item Interscalene block end{enumerate} (1) Indications: Suitable for shoulder, upper arm and forearm surgeries. When local anesthetic is injected at the level of the interscalene, the block effect is strongest in the $ mathrm{C}_{5} sim mathrm{C}_{7}$ dermatome, while the block effect is weaker in the $ mathrm{C}_{8} sim mathrm{T}$ dermatome. Therefore, the interscalene approach brachial plexus block cannot provide good anesthetic effect for surgeries in the ulnar nerve distribution area. (2) Operation method: The interscalene is a triangular area formed by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the omohyoid muscle. The patient lies flat without a pillow, with the head tilted to the opposite side and the arm next to the body (Figure 3-4). Touch the anterior scalene muscle at the outer edge of the clavicular end of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and then slide past the belly of the anterior scalene muscle to the posterior and lateral sides to reach the intermuscular groove between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Draw a horizontal line from the cricoid cartilage backwards, and the intersection with the intermuscular groove is the puncture point. After routine skin disinfection, use a $22 sim 25 mathrm{G}$ puncture needle to vertically pierce the skin, slightly inward and caudal, and observe the reaction of superficial muscle contraction induced by abnormal sensation or electrical stimulation. The sign of accurate positioning is the abnormal sensation or electrical stimulation in the arm or shoulder that triggers muscle contraction. After accurate positioning, fix the needle, and inject local anesthetic $20 sim 30 mathrm{ml}$ if there is no abnormality in the reabsorption. In general, it is difficult to block the ulnar nerve through the intermuscular groove. Placing the patient in a head-high position and pressing above the puncture point will help the local anesthetic spread downward, thereby blocking the ulnar nerve. (3) Advantages and Disadvantages 1) Advantages: (1) Easy to master; (2) Good block effect on the upper arm, shoulder and radial side; (3) Not easy to cause pneumothorax. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Disadvantages: (1) Slow onset of ulnar nerve block; (2) Risk of misdirection into the subarachnoid space or epidural space; (3) Risk of damaging the vertebral artery; (4) Not suitable end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-053(1)} end{center} Figure 3-4 Interscalene approach brachial plexus block Block both sides at the same time to avoid blocking both phrenic nerves or recurrent laryngeal nerves. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Supraclavicular block end{enumerate} (1) Indications: Since the three main trunks of the brachial plexus are concentrated on the clavicle and just above the first rib, the brachial plexus block through the supraclavicular approach is suitable for upper arm, forearm and hand surgery. (2) Procedure: The patient lies flat without a pillow, with the head turned to the opposite side and the upper limbs close to the body (Figure 3-5). The puncture point is located at the lowest point of the intermuscular groove, above and behind the subclavian artery pulsation, which is $1 sim 1.5 mathrm{~cm}$ above the midpoint of the clavicle. Use a $22 mathrm{G}$ puncture needle to pierce the skin caudally until a strange sensation is induced or electrical stimulation triggers a muscle contraction reaction. The needle is fixed and 20 to $30 mathrm{ml}$ of local anesthetic is injected after no abnormal aspiration. If the needle tip touches the first rib but still does not induce abnormal sensation, the puncture needle can be slightly withdrawn and then punctured forward or backward along the rib surface until abnormal sensation is induced. (3) Advantages and Disadvantages 1) Advantages: (1) A more satisfactory block effect can be obtained with a smaller amount of medicine; (2) There is no need to move the upper limbs during puncture, which is more suitable for patients with upper limb trauma and pain; (3) It is not easy to accidentally enter the epidural space or subarachnoid space. 2) Disadvantages: (1) The incidence of pneumothorax is high ($0.5% sim 6%)$, and the symptoms of pneumothorax can be delayed; (2) The incidence of stellate ganglion and phrenic nerve block is high. {3. Axillary block} (1) Indications: The axillary artery is the most important positioning landmark for axillary block. The median nerve is located above the axillary artery, the ulnar nerve is located below it, and the radial nerve is located posteriorly and laterally. The musculocutaneous nerve in the axilla begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-054(1)} end{center} Figure 3-5 Supraclavicular approach to brachial plexus block A. Supraclavicular approach to brachial plexus block method; B. The brachial plexus has left the vascular nerve sheath in the horizontal fossa of the first rib and entered the brachialis muscle; The intercostal brachial nerve from the $ mathrm{T}_{2}$ intercostal nerve branch is located on the surface of the axillary artery. Therefore, axillary brachial plexus block is suitable for surgery from the elbow to the hand, and has the strongest blocking effect in the $ mathrm{C}_{7} sim mathrm{T}_{1}$ (ulnar nerve) skin area, but the blocking effect is slightly worse for shoulder and upper arm $ left( mathrm{C}_{5} sim mathrm{C}_{6} right)$ surgery; at the same time, it is also difficult to block the musculocutaneous nerve, but it can be remedied in the axilla or elbow. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-054} end{center} Figure 3-6 Brachial plexus block via axillary approach (2) Operation method: The patient lies flat on his back with his head tilted to the opposite side. The blocked upper arm is abducted to form a right angle with the trunk. The elbow joint is flexed $90^{circ}$. The shoulder is externally rotated and the upper arm is passed over the head, like a military salute, to fully expose the axilla. First, feel the axillary artery pulsation in the axilla, then feel the strongest pulse along the axillary artery at the lower edge of the pectoralis major muscle, which is the puncture point (Figure 3-6). The puncture needle is inserted into the skin at the edge of the artery, and then the needle is slowly inserted until there is a sense of emptiness or a strange feeling when the sheath is pierced; the finger holding the needle is released, and the needle tip swings with the pulse of the artery, which means that the needle has entered the axillary sheath; after the syringe is connected and no blood is drawn back, the local anesthetic $25 sim 35 mathrm{ml}$ is injected. Axillary block generally does not require looking for a strange feeling, as long as the puncture needle enters the vascular nerve sheath, a good block effect can be obtained, and multiple injections can improve the block effect. During axillary block, the musculocutaneous nerve and intercostobrachial nerve are often not completely blocked. Musculocutaneous nerve block is the basis for complete anesthesia of the forearm and wrist, and successful block of the intercostobrachial nerve can avoid pain at the site of tourniquet application. Therefore, after the injection, the direction of the puncture needle is changed so that the needle tip is located above the axillary artery and inserted perpendicularly to the skin, and the puncture is performed into the brachialis muscle for fan-shaped closure; then the needle is withdrawn to the subcutaneous tissue, and the drug is injected below the axillary artery at the lower edge of the axilla to block the intercostal brachial nerve, which can achieve good results. (3) Advantages and Disadvantages 1) Advantages: (1) The location is superficial, the arterial pulsation is obvious, and it is easy to block; (2) It will not cause pneumothorax; (3) It will not block the phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, and recurrent laryngeal nerve; (4) There is no risk of entering the epidural space or subarachnoid space; (5) A catheter or catheter can be placed for continuous blockade. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Disadvantages: (1) It cannot be used in patients who cannot abduct the upper limbs or have infections or tumors in the axilla; (2) Because the amount of local anesthetic used is large, the incidence of local anesthetic toxicity is higher than other methods. end{enumerate} {IV. Lower limb nerve block} Spinal anesthesia and epidural block are the most commonly used regional anesthesia methods for lower limb surgery. Lower limb nerve block not only provides good anesthesia for lower limb surgery, but also avoids the drop in blood pressure caused by vasodilation because it does not block the sympathetic nerves. It is of great significance for certain critically ill patients.\n",
      "{(I) Anatomy} The nerves that innervate the lower limbs come from the lumbar plexus and the sacral plexus. The lumbar plexus is composed of the lumbar, $_{1} sim$ lumbar $_{4} left( mathrm{~L}_{1} sim mathrm{L}_{4} right)$ anterior branches, often with thoracic ${ }_{12}$ $ left( mathrm{T}_{12} right)$, and occasionally lumbar $ left( mathrm{L}_{5} right)$ branches. The lumbar plexus component composed of $ mathrm{L}_{2} sim mathrm{L}_{4}$ mainly innervates the anterior and medial sides of the thigh; the anterior branches of $ mathrm{L}_{2} sim mathrm{L}_{4}$ form the obturator nerve, the posterior branches form the femoral nerve, and the posterior branches of $ mathrm{L}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{L}_{3}$ form the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (Figure 3-7). The lumbar plexus is located in the psoas intermuscular space between the psoas major and the quadratus lumborum muscles. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-055} end{center} Figure 3-7 Anatomy of the lumbar plexus The lumbar plexus originates from the sacral $ sim$ sacral $ left( mathrm{S}_{1} sim mathrm{S}_{3} right)$ tibialis nerve and the branches of the $ mathrm{L}_{4}$ and $ mathrm{L}_{5}$ anterior branches, mainly forming the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and the sciatic nerve, which together pass through the greater sciatic foramen to pass through the pelvis and control the movement and sensation of the posterior part of the lower limb and the foot. The sciatic nerve contains the main branches of the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve (the ventral branches of the anterior branches of $ mathrm{L}_{4} , mathrm{~L}_{5} , mathrm{~S}_{1} sim mathrm{S}_{3}$ constitute the tibial nerve, and the dorsal branches constitute the common peroneal nerve). After the two branches branch off from the sciatic nerve in the popliteal fossa or above the popliteal fossa, the tibial nerve runs on the medial side while the common peroneal nerve goes around to the lateral side and descends. {(II) Lumbar plexus block (lumbar intermuscular block)} begin{enumerate} item Indications Lumbar plexus block can block the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, femoral nerve and obturator nerve at the same time. Therefore, it is suitable for knee, anterior thigh and iliac surgery; combined with sciatic nerve block, the entire lower limb can be blocked; catheter placement can be used for continuous postoperative analgesia of the iliac and iliac joints. item The method of operation generally adopts the posterior approach. The patient lies on his side with the affected limb placed on top. Confirm the bilateral iliac crests and draw a line, which usually passes through the 4th lumbar vertebra. The puncture point is $5 mathrm{~cm}$ away from the spine on the line on the affected side. The puncture needle is inserted vertically from the puncture point to the transverse process of the 4th lumbar vertebra; then the needle tip slides caudally over the lower edge of the transverse process of the 4th lumbar vertebra; after the needle is inserted for about $0.5 mathrm{~cm}$, there is a clear sense of empty space, indicating that the needle has entered the psoas major muscle space; after no abnormality in the reabsorption, inject $20 sim 30 mathrm{ml}$ of local anesthetic (Figure 3-8). Use a nerve stimulator to locate. When the current is less than $0.5 mathrm{~mA}$ and there is still a quadriceps contraction response, it can be determined that the puncture needle has reached the lumbar plexus. item Complications When the needle is inserted too deep during the posterior approach to lumbar plexus block, there is a risk of entering the epidural space, subarachnoid space or blood vessels; there is also the possibility of causing hematoma and nerve damage. end{enumerate} {(III) Femoral nerve block (the femoral 3 in 1 block)} begin{enumerate} item Indications The femoral nerve mainly innervates the anterior thigh muscles (quadriceps, sartorius and pectineus) and the skin from the inguinal ligament to the knee. Femoral nerve block can be used for anterior thigh and knee surgery, and is often combined with other lower limb block techniques. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-056(2)} end{center} A begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-056(1)} end{center} B Figure 3-8 Lumbar plexus block As shown in Figure A, the puncture needle first reaches the transverse process of the fourth lumbar vertebra (needle 1), and then the needle tip slides caudally over the lower edge of the transverse process of the fourth lumbar vertebra (needle 2) and enters the psoas major space for application. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Operation method The patient lies in the supine position. The femoral artery pulse can be felt at the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. The puncture point is below the inguinal ligament and outside the femoral artery pulse point. Insert the puncture needle in the direction of the head at an angle of $45^{circ}$ to the skin. If there is a strange feeling, it means the position is correct. After the withdrawal is normal, inject local anesthetic $20 sim 30 mathrm{ml}$. When using a nerve stimulator for positioning, the anterior branch of the femoral nerve is usually found first, which is manifested as contraction of the sartorius muscle on the inner side of the thigh. At this time, the needle tip should be slightly moved to the outside and re-inserted. When reaching the posterior branch of the femoral nerve, the quadriceps muscle can be contracted. After the withdrawal is normal, inject local anesthetic (Figure 3-9). When injecting the drug, compress the distal end of the femoral canal at the same time, so that the local anesthetic diffuses proximally into the psoas muscle space, which can not only block the femoral nerve, but also block the obturator nerve and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Therefore, it is also called \"three-in-one block\". However, this method is often incomplete for obturator nerve block, so it is generally regarded as a simple femoral nerve block. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-056} end{center} Figure 3-9 Femoral nerve block begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Complications Since the puncture point is close to the artery, it is easy to accidentally injure the artery or inject local anesthetic into the blood vessel. end{enumerate} {(IV) Sciatic nerve block} begin{enumerate} item Indications The sciatic nerve mainly innervates the iliac crest and all lower limb muscles distal to the knee, as well as all sensations of the lower limb distal to the knee, except for the medial side innervated by the saphenous nerve. In clinical practice, it can be combined with saphenous nerve or femoral nerve block for surgery below the knee joint that does not require a tourniquet. The anterior segment of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve runs along with the sciatic nerve and innervates the skin on the back of the thigh. When the sciatic nerve is blocked, the nerve is also blocked. end{enumerate} {Chapter 3 Local Anesthesia} {2. Operation Method} (1) Classic posterior approach: The patient lies on his side, with the blocked lower limb on top and the hip and knee flexed, with the knee joint at a $90^{circ}$ angle, and the healthy lower limb extended. Draw a line from the greater trochanter of the femur to the posterior superior iliac spine, and draw a vertical line from the midpoint of the line. The intersection of the line with the greater trochanter of the femur and the sacral hiatus is the puncture point (Figure 3-10). Use a $22 mathrm{G}$ puncture needle to insert the needle vertically until abnormal sensation is felt. If there is no abnormal sensation and the bone is touched, the needle tip can be slightly tilted to the inside or outside for puncture. After the abnormal sensation occurs, the needle is withdrawn slightly, and local anesthetic $20 sim 30 mathrm{ml}$ is injected after the aspiration is normal. When using a nerve stimulator, after the gluteal muscle stimulation response occurs, the needle is continued to be advanced until the movement response of the muscles in the innervation area of ​​the sciatic nerve (popliteus or gastrocnemius contraction, foot flexion or toe flexion) is elicited, and local anesthetic is injected after the aspiration is normal. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-057} end{center} Figure 3-10 Posterior approach to sciatic nerve block (2) Anterior approach: The patient lies on his back. Draw a straight line parallel to the inguinal ligament from the greater trochanter. Then divide the line from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle into three equal parts along the inguinal ligament. Draw a vertical line at the middle and inner $1/3$ to intersect with the greater trochanter line. The intersection is the puncture point. Insert the puncture needle vertically and slightly to the outside. When it encounters bone, it is the lesser trochanter of the femur. Slide the needle tip inward over the femur and continue to insert the needle for about $5 mathrm{~cm}$ to induce abnormal sensation. When using a nerve stimulator, muscle contraction reaction may occur. After aspiration is normal, local anesthetic is injected. This method has a deeper puncture site and is more difficult to operate. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Complications Common complications include incomplete block and nerve damage. end{enumerate} {Chapter 4 Spinal Anesthesia} Spinal anesthesia (intrathecal anesthesia) includes subarachnoid block [abbreviated as spinal anesthesia (spinal anesthesia)] and epidural block (epidural anesthesia) (including sacral block). The method of injecting local anesthetics into the subarachnoid space to temporarily block the nerve conduction of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves is called subarachnoid block; the method of injecting local anesthetics into the dura mater to temporarily block the nerve conduction of the spinal nerve roots is called epidural block, abbreviated as epidural block. The characteristics of subarachnoid block are that the dose and volume of anesthetics required are small, but it can achieve complete sensory and motor nerve block and a precise anesthetic effect. Epidural block requires a large dose and volume of local anesthetics, and the absorption of drugs into the blood circulation may cause systemic side effects; its advantage is that it can be continuously administered through catheterization, which is beneficial for surgeries with uncertain duration. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) can take the advantages of both and is increasingly widely used in clinical anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia can effectively block the stress response of surgical stimulation to the body, reduce intraoperative bleeding, and reduce the occurrence of postoperative blood tests; the application of these technologies can shorten the patient's hospital stay, thereby making more effective use of health care funds. {Section 1 Spinal Anatomy and Anesthesia Physiology} {I. Spinal Anatomy} {(I) Structure of the Spine} The spine consists of 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, 5 lumbar vertebrae, 5 sacral vertebrae fused into one piece, and $3 sim 4$ coccygeal vertebrae. The adult spine has four curves, the cervical and lumbar curves are forward, and the thoracic and sacral curves are backward. When lying on your back, the highest point of the spine is at the third lumbar vertebra and the third cervical vertebra, and the lowest point is at the fifth thoracic vertebra and the sacrum (Figure 4-1). The spine is composed of vertebral bodies, vertebral arches, and spinous processes. The intervertebral foramen is formed between the two adjacent upper and lower vertebral arch notches, through which the spinal nerve roots pass. The spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae are arranged horizontally, and the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae are arranged in an imbricate manner. Each vertebral body and the semicircular vertebral arch at the back together form a vertebral foramen. All vertebral foramina are connected in a tubular shape, which is called the vertebral canal. The vertebral canal starts from the foramen magnum on the upper side and ends at the sacral foramen on the lower side; the vertebral canal in the sacral part is called the sacral canal. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-058} end{center} Figure 4-1 Schematic diagram of the physiological curvature of the spine {(II) Ligaments} The lamina of two adjacent vertebrae are connected by three ligaments, in the order from inside to outside: the yellow ligament, the interspinous ligament and the supraspinous ligament (Figure 4-2). The yellow ligament is located between adjacent lamina, and is composed of yellow elastic fibers. It is tough and elastic. It runs from the lower edge of the inner surface of the upper lamina to the upper edge of the outer surface of the lower lamina, and participates in the formation of the posterior wall and posterolateral wall of the spinal canal. The width of the yellow ligament is about $1/2$ of the posterior wall of the spinal canal. It is the toughest and thickest at the waist. When puncturing, the ligament can be touched with the help of the puncture needle. Once the resistance disappears, it means that the epidural space has been entered. The interspinous ligament is located between the spinous processes and is relatively weak. The supraspinous ligament is a longitudinal ligament connecting the tips of the spinous processes. The supraspinous ligament may calcify in the elderly. {Chapter 4 Spinal Anesthesia} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-059} end{center} Figure 4-2 Schematic diagram of lumbar vertebrae anatomy A. Sagittal view; B. Oblique view of lumbar vertebrae; C. Oblique view of a single lumbar vertebra {(III) Spinal cord} The spinal cord is located in the spinal canal, with the upper end starting from the foramen magnum. It fills the entire spinal canal cavity during the embryonic period, ends at the 3rd or 4th lumbar vertebrae in newborns, and ends between the 1st and 2nd lumbar vertebrae in adults. Below the 2nd lumbar vertebrae in adults and below the 3rd lumbar vertebrae in children, there are only spinal nerve roots, namely the cauda equina. Therefore, when performing subarachnoid puncture, the puncture should be performed in the space below the second lumbar vertebra in adults and below the third lumbar vertebra in children to avoid damaging the spinal cord (Figure 4-3).\n",
      "{(IV) Spinal meninges and cavities} The spinal cord has three layers of membranes, namely the pia mater, arachnoid mater and dura mater. The pia mater is closely attached to the surface of the spinal cord, and the cavity formed between it and the arachnoid mater is the subarachnoid space. In addition to the spinal cord, the space under the arachnoid mater is also filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The total volume of cerebrospinal fluid in an adult is about $120 to $150 mathrm{ml}$, of which $25 to 30 mathrm{ml}$ is contained under the arachnoid mater. Normal cerebrospinal fluid is colorless and transparent, with a pH of 7.35 and a specific gravity of 1.003 sim 1.009; the pressure is about 100 mmH_{2} mathrm{O}$ in supine position, 70 sim 170 mmH_{2} mathrm{O}$ in lateral position, and 200 sim 300 mmH_{2} mathrm{O}$ in sitting position. The potential gap between the arachnoid and dura mater is the subdural space, which is wider in the neck and is easily mistaken for the space when performing cervical epidural block or cervical intermuscular groove brachial plexus block. The epidural space is formed between the dura mater and the inner wall of the spinal canal (i.e., the yellow ligament), which is filled with blood vessels, fat, lymph, and loose connective tissue. The volume of the epidural space in adults is about $100 ml, of which the sacral canal accounts for about $25-30 ml. In late pregnancy, the venous plexus of the epidural space is in a dilated state. In the elderly, bone hyperplasia and fibrosis narrow the spinal canal, which can reduce the epidural space. The dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater can extend to both sides along the spinal nerve roots and wrap the spinal nerve roots, respectively called root dura mater, root arachnoid mater, and root pia mater. The root dura mater gradually becomes thinner as it extends toward the intervertebral foramen. The proliferation of arachnoid cells can form hair structures and can penetrate or penetrate the root dura mater. The cavity between the root arachnoid and the root pia mater is called the root subarachnoid space, which is connected to the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord and closes into a blind quench at the intervertebral foramen. When ink is injected into the subarachnoid space, ink particles can be seen accumulating in the root subarachnoid space, so it is also called the ink cuff. Arachnoid hairs are conducive to the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and the removal of particles in the subarachnoid space. {(V) Sacral canal} The sacral canal is a part of the epidural space and is triangular in shape. The sacral canal starts from the dura mater, that is, the level of the second sacral vertebra, and ends at the sacral hiatus. When performing sacral canal puncture, do not exceed the level of the second sacral vertebra to avoid entering the subarachnoid space by mistake. {(VI) Spinal nerves and body surface landmarks} There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, including 8 pairs of cervical nerves, 12 pairs of thoracic nerves, 5 pairs of lumbar nerves, 5 pairs of sacral nerves and 1 pair of coccygeal nerves. Each pair of spinal nerves is divided into anterior roots and posterior roots. The anterior roots are emitted from the anterior horn of the spinal cord and are composed of motor fibers and sympathetic nerve efferent fibers; the posterior roots are composed of sensory fibers and sympathetic nerve afferent fibers. The surface landmarks of the spinal nerve distribution on the human skin are: the thyroid cartilage is $ mathrm{C}_{2}$, the upper edge of the sternum is $ mathrm{T}_{2}$, the line connecting the two nipples is $ mathrm{T}_{4}$, below the xiphoid process is $ mathrm{T}_{6}$, at the level of the umbilicus is $ mathrm{T}_{10}$, and the level of the pubic symphysis is $ mathrm{T}_{12}$ (Figure 4-4). begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-060} end{center} Figure 4-4 Schematic diagram of the distribution of spinal nerves on the body surface $ mathrm{C}=$ cervical $; mathrm{T}=$ thoracic $; mathrm{L}=$ lumbar $; mathrm{S}=$ sacral; $ mathrm{Cocc}=$ coccygeal {II. Physiology of spinal block} begin{enumerate} item Site of action of spinal anesthetic drugs It is currently believed that the main site of action of spinal anesthetic drugs is the spinal nerves. During subarachnoid block, local anesthetics are diluted and diffused by cerebrospinal fluid and directly act on the spinal nerve roots and the surface of the spinal cord, but they mainly act on the spinal nerve roots. The mechanism of epidural block is relatively complex. Most opinions are: 11. Paravertebral block, the drug solution seeps out from the epidural space through the intervertebral foramen and blocks the spinal nerve roots at the paravertebral level; (2) enters the subarachnoid space through the arachnoid hairs and acts on the spinal nerve roots; (3) directly penetrates the dura mater and arachnoid membrane into the subarachnoid space and acts on the spinal nerve roots and the surface of the spinal cord. The order of blockade of item Since the nerve fibers that transmit impulses are different, the order of blockade of local anesthetics is that the autonomic nerve fibers are blocked first, followed by the sensory nerve fibers, and the motor nerve fibers and myelinated proprioceptive fibers ( $ mathrm{A}_{ gamma}$ fibers $)$ are blocked last. The order in which different nerve fibers are blocked is: Vascular contraction $ rightarrow$ Sensation of cold $ rightarrow$ Sensation of warmth $ rightarrow$ Discrimination of different temperatures $ rightarrow$ Slow pain $ rightarrow$ Quick pain $ rightarrow$ Touch $ rightarrow$ Movement $ rightarrow$ Sensation of pressure $ rightarrow$ Proprioception. The order of resolution is the opposite of the blocking order. end{enumerate} {Chapter 4 Spinal Anesthesia} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Differences in block planes The sympathetic nerve block plane is inconsistent with the sensory nerve block plane. Generally, the sympathetic nerve block plane is $2 sim 4$ nerve segments higher than the sensory disappearance plane, and the sensory disappearance plane is $1 sim 4$ segments higher than the motor nerve block plane. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Subarachnoid Block} {I. Clinical Application of Subarachnoid Block} {(I) Indications} begin{enumerate} item Lower abdominal and pelvic surgery Such as appendectomy, hernia repair, bladder and prostate surgery, uterine and adnexa surgery, etc. item Anal and perineal surgery Such as hemorrhoidectomy, abdominal fistula resection, etc., it is more reasonable to use saddle anesthesia. item Lower limb surgery Such as fracture or dislocation reduction of lower limbs, amputation, etc., its analgesic effect is more complete than epidural block, and it can avoid the discomfort caused by tourniquet. item Labor analgesia. end{enumerate} {(II) Contraindications or relative contraindications} begin{enumerate} item Central nervous system diseases Spinal cord or spinal nerve root lesions, chronic or degenerative lesions of the spinal cord, patients with intracranial hypertension. item Systemic severe infection and inflammation or infection at the puncture site. item Shock patients. item Patients with significantly increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as huge abdominal tumors and large amounts of ascites. item Patients with mental illness, severe neurosis, and uncooperative children. item Patients with spinal trauma or a history of obvious low back pain, as well as patients with severe spinal deformities. end{enumerate} {(III) Preparation and medication before anesthesia} begin{enumerate} item Preoperative visit The following issues should be clarified during the preoperative visit: end{enumerate} (1) Whether spinal anesthesia is suitable and whether there are any contraindications to spinal anesthesia. Considering the surgical site and time, whether the application of spinal anesthesia is safe and reliable, and whether the block time is appropriate. (2) Determine the type, dose, concentration and preparation method of the local anesthetic to be used, as well as the patient's position and puncture point. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Medication before anesthesia The amount of medication before anesthesia for subarachnoid block should not be too large, and the patient should be kept awake to facilitate the adjustment of the block plane. end{enumerate} {(IV) Commonly used local anesthetics} begin{enumerate} item Procaine Procaine used for subarachnoid block is a high-purity white crystal. The dosage for adults is $100 sim 150 mathrm{mg}$. The commonly used concentration is $5 %$, the anesthesia onset time is $1 sim 5$ minutes, and the anesthesia maintenance time is $45 sim 90$ minutes. It is suitable for short and small surgeries. The commonly used $5 %$ procaine heavy liquid is prepared as follows: $150 mathrm{mg}$ of procaine is dissolved in $3 mathrm{ml}$ of cerebrospinal fluid. item Tetracaine The commonly used dosage for adults is $8 sim 15 mathrm{mg}$, and the commonly used concentration is $0.3 % sim 0.5 %$. In clinical practice, 1 ml of 1% tetracaine is added with 10% glucose and 3% ephedrine to form a standard formula of tetracaine heavy-weight solution, the so-called 1:1:1 solution. The onset time is 5 sim 10$ minutes, the block plane is fixed after 20 minutes, and the anesthesia is maintained for 2 sim 3$ hours. Bupivacaine is currently the most commonly used drug for subarachnoid block, and the usual dose for adults is 8 sim$ to 15 mg. Generally, 2 ml of 0.5% sim 0.75% bupivacaine is added with 1 ml of cerebrospinal fluid to form a heavy-weight solution, and the anesthesia is maintained for 2 sim 2.5$ hours. Bupivacaine takes $5 sim 10$ minutes to take effect. Do not adjust the anesthesia level too hastily to avoid too high a level. item Levobupivacaine is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. The subarachnoid block dose is the same as that of bupivacaine, and the blocking effect is also equivalent. Theoretically, the systemic toxicity reaction is smaller than that of bupivacaine. item Ropivacaine is a new long-acting amide local anesthetic with low toxicity and high safety. It can produce sensory and motor block separation. The commonly used dose for adults is $8 sim 15 mathrm{mg}$. Generally, $0.5 % sim 0.75 %$ ropivacaine $2 mathrm{ml}$ is used, and $1 mathrm{ml}$ of cerebrospinal fluid is added to make a heavy specific gravity solution. The anesthesia maintenance time is about 2 hours. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(V) Subarachnoid puncture} begin{enumerate} item Body position Subarachnoid puncture is usually performed in the lateral position (Figure 4-5). When using a heavy specific gravity solution, the surgical side is facing downward; when using a light specific gravity solution, the surgical side is facing upward; the saddle area anesthesia is usually performed in a sitting position. item Puncture method The puncture point is infiltrated with $0.5% sim 1%$ procaine or lidocaine in layers, intradermally, subcutaneously, and in the interspinous ligament. There are two commonly used subarachnoid punctures (Figure 4-6). end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-062(1)} end{center} Figure 4-5 $ quad$ Spinal anesthesia puncture position and puncture point positioning method begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-062} end{center} Figure 4-6 Straight entry method and lateral entry method begin{enumerate} item Straight entry method; 2. Lateral entry method end{enumerate} (1) Straight entry method: Use the thumb and index finger of the left hand to fix the skin at the puncture point. Insert the puncture needle perpendicular to the patient's back at the midpoint of the spinous process gap, with the needle tip slightly toward the head, and slowly insert the needle, and carefully feel the change in resistance at the needle tip. When the needle tip passes through the yellow ligament, there is a sudden disappearance of resistance and a \"missing\" feeling. When the needle tip continues to push forward, there is often a second \"missing\" feeling, indicating that the dura mater and arachnoid mater have been penetrated and the subarachnoid space has been entered. (2) Side-entry puncture method: Local infiltration is performed at a distance of $1.5 mathrm{~cm}$ from the midpoint of the interspinous space. The puncture needle is inserted into the interspinous foramen at an angle of $75^{circ}$ to the skin, and then penetrates through the yellow ligament and dura mater to reach the subarachnoid space. This method can avoid the supraspinal and interspinous ligaments and is particularly suitable for patients with supraspinal ligament calcification or spinal deformity. In addition, this method can also be used when the straight-entry puncture method fails. After the needle tip enters the subarachnoid space, cerebrospinal fluid will flow out when the needle core is pulled out. Sometimes, no cerebrospinal fluid outflow may be caused by low intracranial pressure. You can try to compress the jugular vein or let the patient hold his breath to promote cerebrospinal fluid outflow. You can also rotate the needle shaft $180^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, or slowly aspirate with a syringe. If there is still no cerebrospinal fluid outflow after the above treatment, the puncture should be repeated. If bone is encountered during puncture, the direction of needle insertion should be changed to avoid violence to avoid injury. {(VI) Adjustment of the block plane} The block plane refers to the boundary where skin sensation disappears. In clinical practice, it is often judged by the method of skin pain measurement by acupuncture. At the same time, observing the progress of motor nerve paralysis is also helpful to understand its scope of action. For example, when the sacral nerve is blocked, the toes cannot move, and when the lumbar nerve is blocked, the knee cannot be flexed. $ mathrm{T}$, when the nerve is blocked, the abdominal muscles relax, causing the patient to cough. The abdominal muscles can be seen to be soft and bulging, which can roughly determine the plane where the motor nerve fibers are blocked. The dose of local anesthetic is the main factor that determines the plane of subarachnoid blockade. The influencing factors include: puncture gap, patient position, anesthetic volume and specific gravity, injection speed and needle tip bevel direction. (1) Puncture site: Since the spine has four physiological curvatures, if the $ mathrm{L}_{2-3}$ gap is punctured and injected, when the patient turns to lie on his back, the drug solution will move along the slope of the spine to the thoracic segment, making the anesthesia plane higher. If the $ mathrm{L}_{3-4}$ gap is punctured and injected, when the patient lies on his back, most of the drug solution will move toward the sacral segment, the sacral and lower limbs are better anesthetized, and the anesthesia plane is lower. (2) Patient position and specific gravity of the drug solution: A drug solution with a high specific gravity diffuses downward, while a drug solution with a low specific gravity diffuses upward. After injection, the patient's position should generally be adjusted within 5 to 10 minutes to obtain the desired anesthesia plane. (3) Injection speed: Generally, the faster the injection speed, the wider the anesthesia range; conversely, the slower the injection speed, the more concentrated the drug and the smaller the anesthesia range. Generally, $1 ml of drug solution is injected every 5 seconds. When anesthetizing the sellar region, the injection speed can be reduced to $1 ml every 30 seconds to concentrate the drug in the sacrum. (4) The direction of the bevel of the puncture needle tip: If the bevel is toward the head, the anesthesia plane is easy to rise; otherwise, the anesthesia plane is not easy to rise. If the local anesthetic has been injected, the patient's position can only be adjusted according to the specific gravity of the drug to achieve the predetermined anesthesia plane. {(VII) Management during anesthesia} After subarachnoid hydrazone blockade, a series of physiological disturbances may occur, the degree of which is closely related to the blockade plane. The higher the plane, the more obvious the disturbance. begin{enumerate} item Blood pressure drop and slow heart rate After the subarachnoid hydrazone blockade plane exceeds $ mathrm{T}_{4}$, blood pressure drop often occurs, most of which occurs 15 to 30 minutes after injection, accompanied by slow heart rate. The drop in blood pressure is mainly caused by the blockage of sympathetic preganglionic fibers, which causes arteriolar dilation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, blood congestion in peripheral blood vessels, reduced venous return, and decreased cardiac output. The slow heart rate is caused by the blockage of part of the sympathetic nerves and the relative opposition of the vagus nerve. The first thing to consider when dealing with this is to replenish blood volume. Rapid infusion of $200 sim 300 mathrm{ml}$ can be used first; if it is ineffective, ephedrine $10 sim 15 mathrm{mg}$ can be injected intravenously; for patients with slow heart rate, atropine $0.25 sim 0.5 mathrm{mg}$ can be injected intravenously to counteract the influence of the vagus nerve. Item Respiratory depression When the thoracic spinal nerve is blocked, it can cause intercostal muscle paralysis, which is manifested as weak chest breathing and increased abdominal breathing; the patient's tidal volume is reduced, coughing is weak, voicelessness is lost, and even cyanosis occurs. In this case, oxygen should be quickly inhaled, or artificial assisted breathing should be performed until the intercostal muscle tension is restored. If \"full spinal anesthesia\" causes respiratory arrest, a sudden drop in blood pressure, or even cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be performed immediately, and rescue measures such as endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and external chest compression should be adopted. item Nausea and vomiting Causes include: (1) sudden drop in blood pressure, which causes a sudden decrease in cerebral blood supply and excites the vomiting center; (2) impaired vagus nerve function, which increases gastrointestinal motility; (3) traction on internal organs during surgery. Once nausea and vomiting symptoms occur, the first thing to do is to check whether the anesthesia level is too high and the blood pressure is reduced, and take appropriate treatment measures. end{enumerate} {II. Complications of subarachnoid block} begin{enumerate} item Headache after spinal anesthesia Headache is the most common complication after spinal anesthesia. The average incidence of headache after spinal anesthesia is $13%$ in surgical operations and $18%$ in obstetrics and gynecology. Typical headaches can occur within $6 sim 12$ hours after puncture, and most occur $1 sim 3$ days after spinal anesthesia. $75%$ cases last for 4 days, $10%$ last for 1 week, and some can last for 15 months or longer. The main cause of headache after spinal anesthesia is the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the puncture hole, which causes a decrease in intracranial pressure and dilation of intracranial blood vessels. Therefore, the thickness of the puncture needle is significantly related to the incidence of headache. The use of a $25 sim 26 mathrm{G}$ puncture needle can significantly reduce the incidence of headache. After anesthesia, the patient is asked to lie in the supine position to reduce the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid and ensure adequate sleep. Once a headache occurs after spinal anesthesia, treatment can be carried out according to the severity of the headache: (1) Mild headache: It disappears on its own after $2 sim 3$ days of bed rest; (2) Moderate headache: The patient lies flat or with the head down, and receives 2000-3000ml of fluid per day, and small doses of sedatives and analgesics; (3) Severe headache: In addition to the above measures, epidural space filling therapy can be performed, that is, first draw $10 mathrm{ml}$ of autologous blood, or $15 sim 30 mathrm{ml}$ of dextrose, and inject it into the epidural space through the epidural puncture needle within 10 seconds. After injection, the patient lies flat for 1 hour, and the effect is good. Item Urinary retention Due to the blockage of $ mathrm{S}_{2-4}$, the bladder tension may be lost. At this time, the bladder may be overfilled, especially in male patients. If a large amount of fluid is required after surgery, a urinary catheter should be placed before surgery. item Neurological complications Causes of nerve damage caused by spinal anesthesia include: tissue toxicity of local anesthetics, accidental introduction of harmful substances and puncture injuries. end{enumerate} (1) Cranial nerve involvement: The average incidence of cranial nerve involvement after spinal anesthesia is $0.25%$. The VI cranial nerve is more common, accounting for $60%$, followed by the VI cranial nerve. The mechanism is similar. It often occurs $2 sim 21$ days after surgery, and the symptoms are severe headache, photophobia, dizziness, diplopia and strabismus. In addition to giving appropriate analgesics to relieve headaches, vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{1}$ should also be supplemented. (2) Pseudomencinism: Also known as aseptic or chemical meningitis, the incidence is about 1:2000, and it often occurs $3 sim 4$ days after spinal anesthesia. The clinical manifestations are mainly headache and neck stiffness, positive Kernig's sign, and sometimes diplopia, dizziness and vomiting. The treatment method is similar to that of headache after spinal anesthesia. (3) Adhesive arachnoiditis: The reaction of acute meningitis is mostly exudative changes. If the inflammatory stimulation is severe, proliferative changes and fibrosis will occur secondary to it. This proliferative change is called adhesive arachnoiditis. The incubation period is $1 sim 2$ days. It starts with movement disorders and can develop into complete limb paralysis. It is mostly caused by drug chemical stimulation. The treatment is mainly to promote the recovery of neurological function. (4) Cauda equina syndrome: The cause of occurrence is the same as adhesive arachnoiditis. After spinal anesthesia, the patient's lower limb sensation and motor function do not recover for a long time. Neurological examination found that the sacral and coccygeal nerves were affected, fecal incontinence and urethral sphincter paralysis, and recovery was abnormally slow. {Section 3 Epidural Block} {I. Clinical Application of Epidural Block} {(I) Indications and Contraindications} Epidural block is mainly applicable to abdominal surgery, and can also be applied to cervical, upper limb and chest surgery, but it is more complicated to manage. In addition, epidural block can be used for any surgery on the lower abdomen and lower limbs that is suitable for spinal anesthesia. In recent years, general anesthesia combined with epidural block has been advocated for thoracic and abdominal surgery, which can reduce the use of general anesthetics and make anesthesia more stable; indwelling epidural catheters can be used for patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) after surgery. In addition, it can also be used in combination with spinal anesthesia for labor analgesia. Epidural block should be used with caution for patients with severe anemia, hypertension (primary or idiopathic hypertension) and poor cardiac compensation function, and should not be used for patients with severe shock. Patients with inflammation or infection lesions at the puncture site are also considered contraindicated. Patients with dyspnea should not use cervical and thoracic epidural block. {(II) Pre-anesthetic visit and pre-anesthetic medication} begin{enumerate} item Pre-anesthetic visit The purpose is to understand the patient's condition and surgical requirements, determine the puncture site, select the concentration and dosage of local anesthetics, check whether the patient's circulatory system can tolerate anesthesia, check whether the spine is deformed, whether there is infection at the puncture site, as well as the anesthesia history and drug allergy history, coagulation function, water and electrolyte balance, etc. item Pre-anesthetic medication The dosage of local anesthetics for epidural block is relatively large. In order to prevent local anesthetic toxicity, barbiturates or benzodiazepines can be given $1 sim 2$ hours before surgery; for patients with high block plane, large range or high vagus nerve excitability, atropine should be added at the same time to prevent heart rate slowing. For patients with severe pain before surgery, analgesics should be used appropriately. end{enumerate} {（三）Commonly used local anesthetics (Table 4-1)} Table 4-1 Concentrations and doses of commonly used local anesthetics for epidural block begin{center} begin{tabular}{lcccc} hline Local anesthetic & Concentration (%) & begin{tabular}{c} -Maximum dose (mg) end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{c} Onset of action (min) end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{c} Duration (min) end{tabular} hline Azocaine & $2 sim 3$ & 800 & $10 sim 15$ & $45 sim 60$ Tetracaine & $0.2 sim 0.3$ & 75 & $15 sim 20$ & $90 sim 180$ Lidocaine & $1.5 sim 2.0$ & 400 & $5 sim 15$ & $80 sim 120$ Bupivacaine & $0.5 sim 0.75$ & 150 & $10 sim 20$ & $165 sim 225$ Levobupivacaine & $0.5 sim 0.75$ & 150 & $10 sim 20$ & $150 sim 225$ Ropivacaine & $0.5 sim 1.0$ & 200 & $10 sim 20$ & $140 sim 180$ hline end{tabular} end{center}\n",
      "{(IV) Precautions for using local anesthetics} begin{enumerate} item Selection of local anesthetic concentration The most important factor determining the range of epidural blockade is the volume of local anesthetics, and the main factor determining the degree of blockade and the duration of action is the concentration of local anesthetics. The concentration of anesthetics should be appropriately selected according to the puncture site and surgical requirements. Taking lidocaine as an example, $1% sim 1.3%$ is appropriate for cervical and thoracic surgery. Too high a concentration can cause diaphragmatic paralysis; for abdominal surgery, a concentration of $1.5% sim 2%$ is required to relax the abdominal muscles. In addition, the concentration selection is also related to the general condition of the patient. A healthy patient should require a higher concentration, a weak or elderly patient should have a lower concentration, and infants and young children can achieve satisfactory results with a concentration of less than $1%$. Injection method: Generally, the drug can be administered in the following order: (1) Test dose: Generally, it is $2%$ lidocaine $3 sim 5 mathrm{ml}$, the purpose is to exclude the possibility of accidental entry into the subarachnoid space. If pain and movement of the lower limbs disappear and blood pressure drops within 5 minutes after injection, it indicates that the local anesthetic has entered the subarachnoid space. In severe cases, total spinal anesthesia may occur, and emergency treatment should be performed immediately. In addition, the block range and blood pressure fluctuation range of the test dose can be used to understand the patient's tolerance to the drug, so as to guide the dosage of continued medication. (2) Additional dose: 5 minutes after the test dose is injected, if there is no sign of subarachnoid block, the additional dose can be injected. Although the size of the additional dose varies from person to person and the method of administration is also different, the block range should be able to meet the requirements of the operation. The sum of the test dose and the additional dose is called the initial dose. (3) Maintenance dose: During the operation, the patient goes from painless to painful and the muscles go from relaxed to tense. It should be considered that the blocking effect of the local anesthetic has begun to diminish. The maintenance dose can be added, which is generally $1/3 sim 1/2$ of the initial dose. end{enumerate} {(V) Epidural space puncture} begin{enumerate} item Body position There are two types: side-lying position and sitting position. The side-lying position is mainly used clinically. The specific requirements are the same as those of the subarachnoid space block. item Selection of puncture point The puncture point should be selected according to the surgical site. Generally, the puncture point is selected from the corresponding spinous process space of the spinal nerve in the center of the surgical range. To determine the position of each spinous process, the following surface anatomical landmarks can be used as reference: (1) The largest protruding spinous process on the neck is the 7th cervical spinous process; (2) The line connecting the scapular spines on both sides is the 3rd thoracic spinous process; (3) The line connecting the scapular angles is the 7th thoracic spinous process; (4) The line connecting the highest points of the iliac crests on both sides is the 4th lumbar spinous process or the 4-5th lumbar spinous process space. In clinical practice, the 7th cervical spinous process can be used as a landmark to count caudally, or the 4th lumbar spinous process can be used to count cranially to measure the puncture space. Item puncture includes two methods: the straight approach and the side approach. The spinous processes of the cervical, upper thoracic and lumbar spine are arranged in parallel, and the straight approach is often used; the spinous processes of the middle and lower thoracic spine are imbricate, with narrow spaces, and the side approach can be used when puncture is difficult. For elderly people with calcification of the supraspinal ligaments and limited spinal curvature, the side approach is generally used. end{enumerate} (1) Straight approach: Make a skin bump near the upper edge of the inferior spinous process in the selected interspinous space, and then make deep infiltration. Local anesthesia must be perfect, otherwise pain may cause reflex back muscle tension, increasing the difficulty of puncture. The needle must be inserted on the midsagittal line of the spine. The tissue layers passed by the needle tip are the same as those during spinal anesthesia. When penetrating the yellow ligament, there is a sudden disappearance of resistance, indicating that the epidural space has been entered. (2) Lateral approach: The lateral approach is to insert the needle $1.5 mathrm{~cm}$ lateral to the midpoint of the central axis of the interspinous space, avoiding the supraspinous ligament and interspinous ligament, and enter the epidural space through the yellow ligament. Operation steps: Make a skin bump, subcutaneous and muscle infiltration $1.5 mathrm{~cm}$ lateral to the inferior spinous process in the selected interspinous space. The puncture needle is inserted into the interspinous foramen at an angle of $45^{ circ} sim$ $75^{ circ}$ to the skin, and then pierces the yellow ligament through the interspinous foramen to enter the epidural space. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Determination of the epidural space After the puncture needle reaches the yellow ligament, the sudden disappearance of resistance, the appearance of negative pressure, and the absence of cerebrospinal fluid outflow can be used to determine that the puncture needle has entered the epidural space. end{enumerate} (1) Sudden disappearance of resistance: When the puncture needle reaches the yellow ligament, the resistance increases and feels tough; remove the needle core, connect the syringe, push the syringe core, and feel a rebound, indicating that the needle tip has reached the yellow ligament; continue to slowly insert the needle. Once the yellow ligament is pierced, there is a \"falling feeling\" that the resistance suddenly disappears. At the same time, there is no resistance when normal saline is injected, indicating that the needle tip has entered the epidural space (Figure 4-7). (2) Negative pressure phenomenon: In clinical practice, negative pressure phenomenon is often used to determine the epidural space. When the puncture needle reaches the yellow ligament, remove the puncture needle core, hang a drop of saline on the needle stem, and continue to slowly insert the needle. When the needle tip penetrates the yellow ligament and enters the epidural space, the hanging drop can be seen being sucked in. This is the hanging drop method of negative pressure phenomenon (Figure 4-8). The negative pressure phenomenon is more obvious in cervical and thoracic puncture than in lumbar puncture. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-066} end{center} A begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-066(1)} end{center} B Figure 4-8 Schematic diagram of hanging drop puncture A. Hanging drop puncture; B. Puncture needle enters the epidural space {(VI) Continuous epidural block catheterization method} After confirming that the needle tip has entered the epidural space, the epidural catheter can be inserted through the needle pedicle. Before catheterization, the direction of the needle tip bevel should be adjusted according to the planned catheterization direction. The catheter insertion length is preferably $3 sim 5 mathrm{~cm}$. begin{enumerate} item Catheterization operation steps (1) When placing the catheter, the distance from the skin at the puncture point to the epidural space should be measured first, that is, the distance from the needle stalk to the skin is subtracted from the total length of the puncture needle. (2) The operator places the back of the left hand on the patient's back, fixes the needle stalk with the thumb and index finger, holds the tip of the catheter with the right hand, and inserts it into the needle cavity through the needle stalk. There is a slight resistance at $10 mathrm{~cm}$, indicating that the catheter has reached the bevel of the needle tip. Push it forward with a little force, and the catheter can slide into the epidural space. Continue to slowly insert $3 to 5 mathrm{~cm}$ and stop at the $15 mathrm{~cm}$ scale of the catheter. (3) When removing the needle, one hand should withdraw the needle and the other hand should fix the catheter to prevent it from being pulled out. Do not change the bevel direction of the needle tip at will during the needle removal process to prevent the bevel from cutting the catheter. (4) Adjust the length of the catheter in the epidural space. If the catheter is inserted too long, gently pull it out to the predetermined scale. (5) Connect the syringe to the end of the catheter and inject a small amount of saline. If there is no resistance and no blood or cerebrospinal fluid is sucked back, it means that the catheter is unobstructed and in the correct position. The catheter can be fixed. Item Catheterization Precautions (1) When the catheter has passed the bevel of the puncture needle and encounters resistance and needs to be withdrawn and reinserted, the catheter and the puncture needle must be pulled out together. Do not pull out only the catheter, otherwise there is a risk of the bevel of the needle tip cutting the catheter. (2) If the patient has limb abnormal sensation or bounce during the intubation process, it indicates that the catheter has touched the spinal nerve root; if the abnormal sensation is severe, the puncture needle and catheter should be pulled out together and the catheter should be re-punctured. (3) If whole blood flows out of the catheter, it indicates that the catheter has punctured the epidural venous plexus. It can be flushed with saline containing a small amount of epinephrine. If bleeding still occurs, consider changing another spacer for puncture and catheterization. end{enumerate} {(VII) Adjustment of epidural block plane} There are many factors that affect the epidural block plane, the most important of which is the puncture site. If it is not properly selected, the block range will not meet the surgical requirements. In addition, the position and direction of the catheter, the drug volume, the injection speed, the patient's body position and general condition all play an important role. begin{enumerate} item Position and direction of the catheter When the catheter is placed at the head end, the drug tends to diffuse toward the head; when the catheter is placed at the tail end, the drug tends to diffuse toward the tail. If the catheter is biased to one side, unilateral anesthesia may occur. If the catheter is mistakenly placed in the intervertebral foramen, only a single spinal nerve can be blocked. item Drug volume and injection speed The larger the volume, the faster the injection speed, the wider the block range, and vice versa, the narrower the block range. item Body position The drug is injected into the epidural space, and its diffusion is rarely affected by the body position, so it is not necessary to adjust the body position clinically. item Patient condition The epidural space of infants and young children is narrow, and the drug tends to diffuse toward the head, so the amount of drug required is small. Epidural anesthesia in the elderly end{enumerate} {Chapter 4 Spinal anesthesia} The gap is narrowed, the intervertebral foramen is narrowed or even closed, the drug spillage is reduced, the block range is easy to expand, and the dosage should be appropriately reduced. In clinical operation, $2 sim 4 mathrm{ml}$ can be injected first as a test dose, and then the drug can be added in reduced doses as appropriate after observing the size of the block range. In the late pregnancy, due to the compression of the inferior vena cava, the epidural space is filled with veins, the gap becomes relatively smaller, and the drug is easy to diffuse, so the dosage should also be reduced. Some pathological factors, such as poor general condition, dehydration, insufficient blood volume, and increased intra-abdominal pressure, can accelerate the diffusion of drugs, and the dosage should be used with extreme caution. {(VIII) Management of patients during epidural block} Inject local anesthetic $5 sim 10$ within 10 minutes, and there may be sensory numbness in the skin distribution area of ​​2 or 3 segments above and below the puncture site. Within 20 minutes, the block range can be expanded to the expected range, and the anesthesia is also complete. This can cause a series of physiological disturbances, the most common of which are blood pressure drop, respiratory depression and nausea and vomiting. Therefore, attention should be paid to the anesthesia plane during surgery, and the changes in the condition should be closely observed and timely and properly handled. begin{enumerate} item Blood pressure drop This often occurs in thoracic epidural block. Due to paralysis of the visceral nerves, the abdominal blood vessels are dilated, the amount of blood returning to the heart is reduced, and the blood pressure drops. At the same time, the parasympathetic nerve function is relatively improved, and bradycardia may occur. These changes usually occur within 20 minutes after injection. Infusion should be given first to supplement blood volume. If necessary, intravenous injection of ephedrine $10 sim 15 mg $ or phenylephrine $25 sim $ $50 mu mathrm{g}$ can achieve satisfactory results. Item Respiratory depression Block plane below $ mathrm{T}_{8}$ has little effect on respiratory function. During epidural block of the neck and upper chest, respiratory depression may occur due to varying degrees of paralysis of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm. In addition, the epidural space of the neck and chest is relatively small, so small doses and low concentrations of local anesthetics should be used to reduce the blockade of motor nerves. During the operation, the patient's breathing must be carefully observed and emergency preparations must be made. item Nausea and vomiting Epidural blockade cannot eliminate the pulling pain or pulling reflex caused by pulling on the internal organs. Patients often experience chest discomfort, even irritability, nausea, and vomiting. If necessary, auxiliary drugs such as fentanyl $(50 mu mathrm{g})$ can be injected intravenously to control it. end{enumerate} {II. Complications of epidural blockade} {(I) Perforation of the dura mater} begin{enumerate} item Causes The reasons for perforation of the dura mater during epidural puncture include operational factors and patient factors. end{enumerate} (1) Operational factors: (1) Epidural puncture is a blind exploration technique. Beginners may not have a deep understanding of the different layers of intervertebral ligaments during puncture; (2) Anesthesiologists insert the needle too quickly during puncture, or it suddenly slips into the bone; (3) The catheter is too hard, which can also increase the possibility of perforation of the dura mater and is not easy to be discovered. (2) Patient factors: (1) Repeated epidural blockade. Due to repeated trauma, bleeding or chemical stimulation of drugs, the epidural space becomes narrower due to adhesions. The dura mater is often punctured at the same time as the puncture needle passes through the yellow ligament. (2) Spinal deformity, lesions, huge intra-abdominal masses or ascites make it difficult to bend the spine, which makes puncture difficult. Repeated exploratory punctures may puncture the dura mater. (3) The ligaments of the elderly are tantalumized, and they often slip into the subarachnoid space after passing through the yellow ligament. Therefore, the puncture rate of the elderly is 2 times higher than that of the young. (4) The congenital thinness of the dura mater may increase the puncture rate. (5) The epidural space of children is narrower than that of adults, making the operation more difficult and requiring general anesthesia or basic anesthesia. It is easier to puncture the dura mater. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Treatment Once the dura mater is punctured, other anesthesia methods should be changed, such as general anesthesia or nerve block. If the puncture point is below L2 and the surgical area is in the lower abdomen, lower limbs or anal perineum, subarachnoid block can be used with caution. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Needle or catheter misplaced into a blood vessel} begin{enumerate} item The epidural space has a rich vascular plexus. It is not uncommon for a needle or catheter to misplace a blood vessel. The incidence is reported in the literature to be between $0.2% and 2.8%$. Especially in full-term pregnancies, the incidence is higher due to the distended epidural veins. Misplaced blood vessels can be discovered by bleeding from the puncture needle or catheter. In a few cases, it is difficult to discover because the catheter opening is blocked by a blood clot. When injecting the drug, the small blood clot is pushed away, and the local anesthetic is directly injected into the blood vessel, causing a toxic reaction. item Preventive measures (1) The catheter should be inserted from the midline; (2) After the catheter is placed, gently aspirate before injecting the local anesthetic to verify the presence of blood; (3) Routinely inject a test dose of local anesthetic through the catheter; (4) If there is blood in the catheter or the syringe containing the local anesthetic, be alert to the possibility that the catheter has entered the blood vessel. Item Treatment If blood flows out of the puncture needle or catheter, the catheter can be withdrawn by $1 mathrm{~cm}$ and flushed with $10 mathrm{ml}$ of normal saline, which can usually stop or relieve the symptoms; if the symptoms cannot be relieved, the interval can be changed and the puncture can be repeated, or other anesthesia methods can be used. However, patients with coagulation disorders are at risk of epidural hematoma, and should be closely observed after surgery to detect and treat the symptoms in a timely manner. If the catheter enters the blood vessel and is not detected in time, and local anesthetics are injected, causing local anesthetic toxicity, the patient should be treated immediately according to the local anesthetic toxicity reaction. end{enumerate} {(III) Catheter breakage} begin{enumerate} item Causes (1) When the tip of the catheter cannot go further after passing the bevel of the puncture needle, if you try to withdraw the catheter alone, the catheter may be cut by the bevel of the puncture needle; (2) In patients with osteoarthritis, the lamina or interspinous ligament clamps the catheter, making it difficult to remove the catheter. If you pull it out forcefully, the catheter may be broken; (3) The catheter is folded or knotted in the epidural space, making it difficult to remove the catheter. In this case, you must cut through each layer of tissue until the fold or knot is reached before you can remove it. item Treatment Because the catheter stump may be in the epidural space or in the soft tissue, it is difficult to locate. Surgical removal is more traumatic and may not be successful. Therefore, immediate surgical removal is generally not recommended. Residual catheters generally do not cause complications, but the patient should be informed after the incident to eliminate concerns, gain understanding and cooperation, and be carefully observed and followed up. If the catheter end is found under the skin immediately after the operation, an incision can be made under local anesthesia to remove it. end{enumerate} {(IV) Total Spinal Anesthesia} During epidural blockade, if the puncture needle or epidural catheter is mistakenly inserted into the subarachnoid space and is not discovered in time, a local anesthetic several times the amount of spinal anesthesia is injected into the subarachnoid space, which can produce an abnormally extensive blockade and total spinal anesthesia. Clinical manifestations are no pain sensation, hypotension, loss of consciousness and respiratory arrest in all areas innervated by the spinal nerves. The symptoms and signs of total spinal anesthesia often appear within a short period of time after injection. If not handled in time, cardiac arrest may occur. Therefore, the operating procedures should be strictly followed and the \"test dose\" should not be omitted. Treatment principles: (1) Maintain the patient's respiratory and circulatory functions. If the patient loses consciousness, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should be performed, and infusion should be accelerated. If necessary, vasoactive drugs should be given to increase blood pressure; (2) If cardiac arrest occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be performed immediately. {(V) Spinal nerve root or spinal cord injury} begin{enumerate} item Spinal nerve root injury The nerve root may be directly damaged by the puncture needle. If the patient complains of electric shock-like pain during the puncture process and it is transmitted to one side of the limbs, the needle should be stopped to avoid aggravating the injury. Spinal nerve root injury is mainly in the posterior root, and the clinical manifestation is burning or pain in the distribution area of ​​the damaged nerve root. If the thoracic spinal nerve root is damaged, it will present as \"band-like pain\", and the limbs will be distributed in strips, which may be manifested as decreased or absent sensation. The typical accompanying phenomenon of root pain symptoms is cerebrospinal fluid impact sign, that is, the pain or numbness will be aggravated when coughing, sneezing or holding the breath. Root pain is most severe within 3 days after injury, and then gradually alleviates. Most patients will be relieved or disappear within 2 weeks. The remaining patchy numbness area may also last for more than several months, and symptomatic treatment can be used. item Spinal cord injury The puncture needle or catheter can also directly damage the spinal cord. When the spinal cord is touched, the patient will have an electric shock-like abnormal sensation in the limbs. In mild cases, the sensation disappears within a few minutes, but in severe cases, the abnormal sensation persists. Block anesthesia should be abandoned to avoid aggravating neurological complications. If a catheter is inserted into the spinal cord or local anesthetic is injected into the spinal cord, it can cause severe damage or even transverse damage. The patient will immediately feel severe pain, occasionally have transient consciousness disorders, and completely flaccid paraplegia. In transverse spinal cord damage, blood pressure is low and unstable. The prognosis of paralysis caused by severe damage is poor. end{enumerate} Differentiation between early spinal cord injury and spinal nerve root injury: (1) Spinal nerve root injury causes \"electric shock\" or pain, while spinal cord injury causes severe pain, occasionally accompanied by transient loss of consciousness; (2) Spinal nerve root injury is mainly characterized by sensory impairment, with typical \"root pain\", and rarely motor impairment; (3) After spinal nerve root injury, sensory loss is limited to the skin area innervated by the $1 sim 2$ root spinal nerve, which is consistent with the plane of the spinous process at the puncture point; while the sensory impairment of spinal cord injury is not in the same plane as the puncture point, one segment lower in the neck, two segments lower in the upper chest, and three segments lower in the lower chest. {(VI) Epidural hematoma} The epidural space has a rich venous plexus, and the puncture bleeding rate is about $2% sim 6%$, but the incidence of complications caused by hematoma is only $0.0013% sim 0.006%$. The direct cause of hematoma formation is damage to the puncture needle and the catheter. If the patient has coagulation dysfunction or takes anticoagulants, the chance of epidural hematoma increases. Although epidural hematoma is rare, it ranks first among the causes of epidural block with amputation. Clinical manifestations: back pain at the beginning, muscle weakness and sphincter disorders after a short time, and then complete amputation. If the anesthetic effect persists after epidural block, or if sensory loss, muscle weakness or even paraplegia reappears after the anesthetic disappears, it is a sign of hematoma compression of the spinal cord; spinal canal angiography, CT or magnetic resonance imaging is very helpful for clarifying the diagnosis and the location of the blockage; cerebrospinal fluid examination only has a slightly high protein content, and the neck compression test indicates spinal canal obstruction. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and timely surgery. If laminectomy is performed as soon as possible (within 8 hours) after the diagnosis is confirmed to remove the hematoma, the symptoms can be relieved and the prognosis is good. If the operation is performed more than 12 hours later, the possibility of recovery is extremely small. Therefore, epidural blockade should be avoided for patients with coagulation disorders and those who are currently receiving anticoagulant therapy; during the puncture operation, it should be emphasized to avoid violence and repeated punctures. {III. Sacral canal blockade} Sacral canal blockade is a puncture through the sacral hiatus, where local anesthetics are injected into the sacral canal cavity to block the sacral spinal nerves. It is an epidural blockade. It is suitable for rectal, anal and perineal surgeries, and is also used for abdominal surgeries in infants and preschoolers. begin{enumerate} item Method for locating the puncture point From the tip of the coccyx along the midline to the head $3 sim 4 mathrm{~cm}$ (adults), an elastic $ mathrm{V}$-shaped depression can be touched. On both sides of the depression, the sacral horns with large bony protrusions can be touched. The depression located at the midpoint of the line connecting the two sacral horns is the puncture point, the sacral hiatus (Figure 4-9). The line connecting the posterior superior iliac spines is at the second sacral vertebral plane, which is the end of the dura mater. If the sacral canal puncture needle crosses this line, there is a risk of entering the subarachnoid space by mistake and causing total spinal anesthesia. item puncture and injection The patient takes a side-lying or prone position. In the side-lying position, the waist and back should be arched backward as much as possible, and the knees should be bent toward the abdomen. In the prone position, a thick pillow should be placed on the hips to raise the pelvis and expose the sacrum. Make an intradermal hillock in the center of the sacral hiatus, but do not make subcutaneous infiltration, otherwise the bone mark will be unclear and hinder the location of the puncture point. Insert the puncture needle vertically into the skin. When the sacrococcygeal ligament is punctured, you can feel the resistance disappear. At this time, tilt the needle shaft to the caudal side, make a $30^{ circ} sim 45^{ circ}$ angle with the skin, and push $2 mathrm{~cm}$ to reach the sacral canal cavity. Connect the syringe, aspirate no cerebrospinal fluid, inject saline and air without resistance, and no skin bulge, confirming that the needle tip is indeed in the sacral canal cavity, and then inject the test dose. Observe for 5 minutes to see if there is no subarachnoid block, and then inject the remaining liquid in batches. end{enumerate} The key to successful puncture is to master the direction of the puncture needle. If the angle between the needle and the caudal skin is too small, that is, the needle body is too flat, the needle tip may be blocked by the posterior wall of the sacral canal; if the angle is too large, the needle tip can often touch the anterior wall of the sacral canal. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-069} end{center} Figure 4-9 Schematic diagram of sacral canal puncture technique If bone is encountered during puncture, force should not be used. The needle should be withdrawn a little and the needle should be inserted after adjusting the inclination of the needle body to avoid causing severe pain and damaging the sacral canal venous plexus. When a large amount of blood is returned during aspiration, sacral canal block should be abandoned and lumbar epidural block should be used instead. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Commonly used local anesthetics $1 % sim 1.5 %$ lidocaine, $0.5 %$ bupivacaine or $0.5 %$ ropivacaine are commonly used. Injecting $15 sim 20 mathrm{ml}$ of local anesthetic can meet the anesthetic effect of sacral canal block. item Complications There are abundant venous plexuses in the sacral canal cavity, and it is easy to bleed during puncture. The absorption of local anesthetics is also fast, and local anesthetic toxicity is easy to occur. If the injection is too fast, it may cause dizziness and headache. Because the anatomical variation of the sacral hiatus is large, the failure rate of block is high. Because the sacral nerve block lasts for a long time, there is more urine retention after surgery. end{enumerate} {Section 4 Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia} Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA; referred to as combined spinal-epidural anesthesia) has been widely used in abdominal and pelvic surgery in recent years, and has achieved satisfactory results. Abdominal and pelvic surgery requires anesthesia to provide adequate analgesia and muscle relaxation, so a more extensive block is often required, the upper limit of anesthesia needs to reach $ mathrm{T}_{6}$, the lower limit needs to reach $ mathrm{S}_{4}$, and the operation time is long. If epidural block is used, double-tube continuous epidural block should be used. This method is not only complicated to operate, but also requires a large amount of local anesthetics. Some patients still have pelvic visceral traction reactions, and often need to be supplemented with a large amount of analgesics to complete the surgical operation. Spinal-epidural combined block not only retains the advantages of fast onset of spinal anesthesia, perfect analgesia and good muscle relaxation, but also facilitates the adjustment of the anesthesia plane to prevent the anesthesia plane from being too high. Additional local anesthetics through the epidural catheter can make up for the shortcomings of insufficient spinal anesthesia block plane or insufficient block time. Spinal-epidural combined block can use two-point puncture method or one-point puncture method. Drugs are injected into the subarachnoid space, and epidural catheters are also placed through this puncture needle. When the two-point puncture method is used, first select the appropriate puncture gap according to the surgical site for epidural puncture, and leave the epidural catheter in reserve; then perform subarachnoid puncture at $ mathrm{L}_{2-3}$ or $ mathrm{L}_{3-4}$, and inject local anesthetic for spinal anesthesia. When the one-point puncture method is used, a special combined puncture needle is used to select the $ mathrm{L}_{2-3}$ gap for puncture. When the epidural puncture is successful, use a $25 mathrm{G}$ spinal anesthesia needle to perform spinal anesthesia puncture through the lumen of the epidural puncture needle; when the cerebrospinal fluid flows out, the required local anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space (spinal anesthesia); then withdraw the spinal anesthesia puncture needle, and then insert an epidural catheter $3 sim 5 mathrm{~cm}$ through the epidural puncture needle to the head end. After the catheter is placed, withdraw the epidural puncture needle and properly fix the epidural catheter (Figure 4-10). includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-070} Figure 4-10 Schematic diagram of combined spinal-epidural block The spinal puncture needle used in combined spinal-epidural block is thinner, and the injection time takes $45 sim 60$ seconds, but the amount of spinal and epidural drugs used is less than that of the two-point puncture method. The one-point puncture method causes less damage to the patient, and due to the use of a $25 mathrm{G}$ spinal puncture needle, the incidence of postoperative headache is also significantly reduced. The advantages of using CSEA are shown in Table 4-2. Table 4-2 Advantages of CSEA begin{enumerate} item The spinal needle is guided by the epidural puncture needle to puncture the subarachnoid space, which reduces the possibility of the spinal needle hitting the bone surface and causing the needle tip to become blunt item Drug administration through the epidural catheter can not only make up for the limited time of spinal anesthesia, but also can be used for postoperative analgesia item Compared with simple epidural block, spinal anesthesia is quick to take effect and has a complete block, which can allow the operation to start earlier item Spinal anesthesia requires a small amount of medication, which can reduce the blood concentration of local anesthetics and reduce physiological interference; if necessary, epidural administration can improve the block plane item When used for labor analgesia, a small dose of opioids can be injected into the subarachnoid space through the spinal needle, and analgesics and local anesthetics can be added through the epidural catheter when necessary end{enumerate}\n",
      "{Chapter 5 General Anesthesia} Anesthetics are inhaled into the human body through the respiratory tract or injected intravenously or intramuscularly, producing central nervous system depression. Clinical manifestations include loss of consciousness, systemic loss of pain sensation, amnesia, reflex inhibition, and a certain degree of muscle relaxation. This method is called general anesthesia. The degree of central nervous system depression caused by anesthetics is related to the drug concentration in the blood and can be regulated. This depression is completely reversible. When the drug is metabolized or excreted from the body, the patient's consciousness, sensation, and various reflexes gradually recover. In order to ensure the safety of the patient, general anesthesia generally requires the establishment of an artificial airway. For those who undergo short surgeries and it is easy to keep the airway open, an artificial airway may not be established. Since the patency of the patient's airway is not guaranteed and it is difficult to implement effective artificial respiration, general anesthesia without the establishment of an artificial airway may be more dangerous. General anesthesia is different from ordinary sleep. General anesthesia produces varying degrees of depression and even disappearance of the central nervous system, respiratory and circulatory systems, and responses to noxious stimuli. {Section 1 General anesthetics} According to the route of administration and the mechanism of action of the drug, general anesthetics can be divided into inhalation anesthetics and intravenous anesthetics. Muscle relaxants (abbreviated as \"muscle relaxants\") and narcotic analgesics are generally regarded as adjuvant drugs for general anesthesia. {I. Inhalation anesthetics} Inhalation anesthetics (inhalation anesthetics) refer to drugs that are inhaled into the human body through the respiratory tract and produce general anesthetic effects. They can be used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. {(I) Physicochemical properties and pharmacological properties} Most of the commonly used inhalation anesthetics today are halogens. After being inhaled through the respiratory tract, they produce general anesthetic effects through interaction with brain cell membranes. The strength of inhalation anesthetics is measured by minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). MAC refers to the minimum alveolar concentration at which a certain inhalation anesthetic can prevent $50%$ patients from shaking their heads or moving their limbs during skin incision when it is inhaled simultaneously with pure oxygen at one atmosphere. Because MAC is the equivalent concentration of different anesthetics, it can reflect the efficacy of anesthetics. The smaller the MAC of an anesthetic, the stronger its anesthetic efficacy. The oil/gas partition coefficient (i.e., lipid solubility) and blood/gas partition coefficient (i.e., the solubility of the drug in the blood) of inhaled anesthetics have a significant effect on their pharmacological properties. As can be seen from Table 5-1, the strength of inhaled anesthetics is proportional to their oil/gas partition coefficient. The higher the oil/gas partition coefficient, the greater the anesthetic intensity and the smaller the MAC. The depth of anesthesia is related to the partial pressure of inhaled anesthetics in the brain. When the partial pressure of inhaled anesthetics in the alveoli, blood, and brain tissue reaches equilibrium, the alveolar drug concentration $left(mathrm{F}_{mathrm{A}} right)$ can reflect the distribution of inhaled anesthetics in the brain. Table 5-1 Physical and chemical properties of inhaled anesthetics begin{center} begin{tabular}{lccccc} hline Drug & Molecular weight & Oil/gas & Blood/gas & Metabolic rate( %) & MAC( %) hline Ether & 74 & 65 & 12 & $2.1 sim 3.6$ & 1.9 Nitrous oxide & 44 & 1.4 & 0.47 & 0.004 & 105 Halothane & 197 & 224 & 2.4 & $15 sim 20$ & 0.75 Enflurane & 184 & 98 & 1.9 & $2 sim 5$ & 1.7 Isoflurane & 184 & 98 & 1.4 & 0.2 & 1.15 Heptafluorane & 200 & 53.4 & 0.65 & $2 sim 3$ & 2.0 Desflurane & 168 & 18.7 & 0.42 & 0.02 & 6.0 hline end{tabular} end{center} The controllability is related to its blood/gas partition coefficient. The lower the blood/gas partition coefficient, the shorter the time it takes for the partial pressure in the alveoli, blood and brain tissue to reach equilibrium, and thus the concentration in the central nervous system is easier to control. Therefore, the blood/gas partition coefficients of nitrous oxide (laughing gas), desflurane and sevoflurane are low, and their induction and recovery rates are faster. {(II) Factors affecting alveolar drug concentration} Inhaled anesthetics are carried into the respiratory tract and alveoli through the fresh air flow flowing through the inhaled anesthetic vaporizer of the anesthesia machine, so that the partial pressure of the inhaled anesthetic in the alveoli increases. Driven by the partial pressure difference, the inhaled anesthetic diffuses across the alveolar membrane into the blood flowing through the alveoli (i.e., the pulmonary circulation takes up the drug), and transports the drug to the central nervous system or other tissues through the blood circulation. After the inhaled anesthetic stops, the inhaled anesthetic diffuses from various organs and tissues in the body into the venous blood, diffuses into the alveolar gas, and is excreted from the body through the respiratory tract. The alveolar drug concentration $left(mathrm{F}_{mathrm{A}} right)$ refers to the concentration of the inhaled anesthetic in the alveoli, while the inhaled drug concentration $left(F_{1} right)$ refers to the concentration of the drug entering the respiratory tract from the loop. In clinical practice, $F_{A}$ and $F_{A} / F_{1}$ are often used to compare the rate of increase in the alveolar concentration of different drugs. The rate of increase of $F_{A}$ and $F_{A} / F_{1}$ depends on the rate of anesthetic delivery and uptake by the pulmonary circulation. The influencing factors are: begin{enumerate} item Ventilation effect Increased alveolar ventilation can deliver more drugs to the alveoli to compensate for the drug uptake by the pulmonary circulation, which accelerates the rate of increase in $F_{A}$ and $F_{A} / F_{1}$. The larger the blood/gas distribution coefficient of the drug, the more it is absorbed by the blood. Therefore, for drugs with a large blood/gas distribution coefficient, the effect of increased ventilation on the increase in $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ and the increase in $ mathrm{FA} / mathrm{F}_{1}$ is more obvious. item Concentration effect The inhaled drug concentration $ left( mathrm{F}_{1} right)$ can not only affect the level of $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$, but also affect the speed at which $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ rises, that is, the higher $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ is, the faster $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ rises, which is called the concentration effect. If the inhaled concentration is $100%$ (a hypothetical theoretical value, because oxygen needs to be inhaled at the same time), $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ rises very quickly. Because at this time $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ only depends on the speed at which gas is transported into the lungs during alveolar ventilation, the drug uptake by the pulmonary circulation can no longer limit the rising speed of $F_{A} / F_{1}$. item Cardiac output (CO) Anesthetic drugs are transferred from alveoli to blood by diffusion under the drive of partial pressure difference. When alveolar ventilation remains unchanged, cardiac output increases, blood flow through the pulmonary circulation also increases, and the anesthetic drugs taken up and removed by the blood also increase, resulting in a slower rise in $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$. The effect of cardiac output on $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ is also related to the blood/gas distribution coefficient of the drug. The larger the blood/gas distribution coefficient, the more blood uptake caused by the increase in cardiac output, and the more obvious the reduction in $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$. item Blood/gas distribution coefficient The higher the blood/gas distribution coefficient, the more anesthetic drugs are taken up by the blood, the slower the rise in $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$, the longer the anesthesia induction period, and the slower the recovery from anesthesia. From a clinical perspective, the lower the blood/gas distribution coefficient, the faster the $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ rises during the anesthesia induction period, the faster the $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}}$ decreases during the anesthesia recovery period, the easier it is to achieve a balance between the alveoli, blood and brain tissue, and the easier it is to control the depth of anesthesia. The controllability of inhaled anesthetics is inversely proportional to the blood/gas distribution coefficient. The greater the difference in the concentration of anesthetics in the alveoli and venous blood, the more drugs are taken up by the pulmonary circulation, that is, the more anesthetics are taken away from the alveoli by the pulmonary blood. In the early stage of anesthesia induction, the anesthetics in the mixed venous blood are close to zero, and $ mathrm{F}_{A-V}$ is large, which promotes the uptake of anesthetics by the blood. As anesthesia deepens and the duration of anesthesia increases, the concentration of anesthetics in venous blood increases, which reduces $ mathrm{F}_{ mathrm{A}- mathrm{v}}$, slows down the uptake rate, and reduces the uptake amount, eventually reaching a relatively stable state. end{enumerate} {(III) Metabolism and toxicity} Most inhaled anesthetics are highly lipid-soluble and difficult to be excreted in their original form by the kidneys. Most of them are excreted through the respiratory tract, and only a small part is excreted in the urine after metabolism in the body. The main metabolic site of drugs is the liver. Cytochrome P450 is an important drug oxidation metabolism enzyme that can accelerate the oxidative metabolism of drugs. In addition, some drugs have drug metabolism enzyme induction effects, which can accelerate their own metabolic rate. The metabolic process of drugs and their metabolites have different degrees of influence on the functions of the liver and kidneys. The degree of influence is related to the drug metabolism rate and the toxicity of the metabolic intermediates and final products. Generally speaking, the lower the drug metabolism rate, the lower its toxicity. As can be seen from Table 5-1, desflurane and iodine have the lowest metabolic rates, and therefore their toxicity is also the lowest, followed by enflurane and sevoflurane, while halothane has the highest. The main cause of nephrotoxicity is the increase in the concentration of inorganic fluorine $left( mathrm{F}^{-} right)$ in the blood. It is generally believed that when the $mathrm{F}^{-}$ concentration is lower than $50 mu mathrm{mol} / mathrm{L}$, no nephrotoxicity will occur; $50 sim 100 mu mathrm{mol} / mathrm{L}$ may cause nephrotoxicity; and when it is higher than $100 mu mathrm{mol} / mathrm{L}$, nephrotoxicity will definitely occur. Under enzyme induction, the F- concentration can increase significantly. Therefore, halogen inhaled anesthetics should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal insufficiency or those who use enzyme-inducing drugs. {Chapter 5 General Anesthesia}\n",
      "{(IV) Commonly used inhaled anesthetics} begin{enumerate} item Nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide, $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$, laughing gas) is a gaseous anesthetic with weak anesthetic properties, and its $ mathrm{MAC}$ is estimated to be $105%$. Amnesia can occur when the inhaled concentration is greater than $60%$. Nitrous oxide has a certain direct inhibitory effect on the myocardium, but has no significant effect on cardiac output, heart rate and blood pressure, which may be related to its ability to excite the sympathetic nervous system. It has a contractile effect on pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and leading to increased right atrial pressure, but has no significant effect on peripheral vascular resistance. It has a mild inhibitory effect on respiration, reducing tidal volume and accelerating respiratory rate, but is non-irritating to the respiratory tract and does not damage lung tissue. Because of its low blood/gas distribution coefficient, the equilibrium speed between alveolar concentration and inhaled concentration is very fast. Changes in alveolar ventilation or cardiac output have no significant effect on the speed of pulmonary circulation uptake of $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$. $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ can cause an increase in cerebral blood flow and a slight increase in intraocular pressure. $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ is almost entirely discharged from the respiratory tract in its original form, with no significant effect on liver and kidney function. end{enumerate} Clinical application: It is often used in combination with other general anesthetics for anesthesia maintenance, and the commonly used inhaled concentration is 50% 70%. Inhaled $50%$ $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ can be used for dental or obstetric analgesia. During anesthesia, the inhaled oxygen concentration $ left( mathrm{FiO}_{2} right)$ must be maintained above 0.3 to avoid hypoxemia. During the recovery period of $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ anesthesia, diffuse hypoxia may occur. After stopping $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ inhalation, pure oxygen should be inhaled for $5 sim 10$ minutes. $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ can increase the internal pressure of closed cavities in the body (such as the middle ear and intestinal cavity). Therefore, it is not suitable for pneumothorax, intestinal obstruction, extracorporeal circulation, thoracoscopic and laparoscopic surgeries. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Enflurane has strong anesthetic properties. Enflurane has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system (CNS). As the inhaled concentration gradually increases (>3%), pop-like spikes and burst inhibition may appear on the electroencephalogram (EEG). It has an inhibitory effect on myocardial contractility, causing a decrease in blood pressure, cardiac output and myocardial oxygen consumption. It has a mild dilating effect on peripheral blood vessels, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure and a reflex increase in heart rate. Although enflurane can also increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to catecholamines, the dosage of adrenaline at $4.5 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$ will not cause arrhythmias. It is non-irritating to the respiratory tract and does not cause an increase in saliva and airway secretions. It has a strong inhibitory effect on respiration, manifested as a decrease in tidal volume and an increase in respiratory rate. It can enhance the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. The main metabolite $ mathrm{F}^{-}$ is nephrotoxic. After long-term use of isoniazid treatment and obese patients inhale enflurane, the $ mathrm{F}^{-}$ concentration in plasma can increase; but after general clinical anesthesia, the plasma F･ concentration is lower than the nephrotoxic threshold. end{enumerate} Clinical application: It is often used for the maintenance of anesthesia. The inhalation concentration during the maintenance period is $0.5% sim 2%$. Enflurane can reduce intraocular pressure, which is beneficial for intraocular surgery. Because the EEG shows spasmodic attacks during deep anesthesia, and the clinical manifestations are facial and muscle twitching, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of eczema. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Isoflurane has strong anesthetic properties. At low concentrations, isoflurane has no effect on cerebral blood flow. At high concentrations (>1MAC), it can dilate cerebral blood vessels, increase cerebral blood flow, and increase intraocular pressure. It has a mild inhibitory effect on myocardial contractility and a small effect on cardiac output, but can significantly reduce peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure; it does not increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to exogenous catecholamines. It has a mild inhibitory effect on respiration and a dilating effect on bronchial smooth muscle. It can enhance the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. The metabolic rate is very low, and the final metabolite is trifluoroacetic acid. During clinical anesthesia, the highest plasma $ mathrm{F}^{-}$ concentration is less than $10 mu mathrm{mol} / mathrm{L}$; when enzyme inducers are used, there is no significant increase in liver metabolism and $ mathrm{F}^{-}$ concentration. Therefore, there is no significant effect on liver and kidney function. end{enumerate} Clinical application: It is often used to maintain anesthesia. When the inhaled concentration is $0.5% sim 2%$, the circulatory function can be kept stable; awakening is fast after drug withdrawal, about 10-15 minutes. Because it has a slight inhibitory effect on myocardial contractility and a significant dilation of peripheral blood vessels, it can be used for controlled hypotension. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Sevoflurane has a strong anesthetic property. Sevoflurane has an inhibitory effect on the CNS, a dilating effect on cerebral blood vessels, and can cause an increase in intracranial pressure. It has a mild inhibitory effect on myocardial contractility, can reduce peripheral vascular resistance, and cause a decrease in arterial pressure and cardiac output. It has no effect on the myocardial conduction system and does not increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to exogenous catecholamines. It has a significant dilating effect on the coronary artery at a concentration above 1.5MAC, and may cause coronary steal. It is non-irritating to the respiratory tract and does not increase respiratory secretions. It has a relatively strong inhibitory effect on respiration and has a dilating effect on tracheal smooth muscle. It can enhance the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants and prolong their duration of action. It is mainly metabolized in the liver to produce $ mathrm{F}^{-}$ and organic fluorine. After clinical anesthesia, the plasma $ mathrm{F}^{-}$ concentration is generally $ mathrm{F}^{-}$, which is below the renal toxicity threshold. end{enumerate} Clinical application: It can be used for anesthesia induction and maintenance. When induced by mask, the incidence of choking and breath holding is very low. Anesthesia was maintained for 8.6 minutes. The recovery process was smooth, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting was low. However, it can decompose in soda lime, especially when the soda lime is dry and the temperature is elevated. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Desflurane has weak anesthetic properties. It can inhibit the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex and reduce the brain's oxygen metabolism rate; although low concentrations do not inhibit the central nervous system's response to $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, hyperventilation does not reduce the intraocular pressure; high concentrations can dilate cerebral blood vessels and reduce their self-regulatory ability. It has a mild inhibitory effect on myocardial contractility and a mild effect on heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output; when the concentration increases, it can cause a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a decrease in blood pressure. It does not increase the myocardial sensitivity to exogenous catecholamines. It has a mild inhibitory effect on respiration, can inhibit the body's response to elevated $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, and has a mild irritating effect on the respiratory tract. It has an inhibitory effect on the neuromuscular junction and can enhance the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. It is almost completely excreted by the lungs. Except for long-term or high-concentration applications, its metabolic rate in the body is extremely low, so its liver and kidney toxicity is very low. end{enumerate} Clinical application: It can be induced by mask alone, or it can be used alone or in combination with $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ to maintain anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is highly controllable and the amount of muscle relaxants is reduced. Because it has less impact on circulatory function, it may be more beneficial for anesthesia of cardiac surgery or non-cardiac surgery in patients with heart disease. Because of its rapid induction and awakening, it is also suitable for anesthesia of outpatient surgery patients, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting is significantly lower than other inhaled anesthetics. However, it requires a special vaporizer and is more expensive. {II. Intravenous anesthetics} Drugs that are injected into the human body through the vein and act on the central nervous system through the blood circulation to produce general anesthesia are called intravenous anesthetics. Its advantages are fast induction, no irritation to the respiratory tract, and no environmental pollution. Commonly used intravenous anesthetics are: begin{enumerate} item Thiopental sodium ( thiopental sodium) is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate intravenous general anesthetic. The commonly used concentration is $2.5%$, and its aqueous solution is strongly alkaline, with a $ mathrm{pH}$ of $10 sim 11$. Thiopental sodium easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and enhances the inhibitory effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter $ gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, thereby affecting the conduction of synapses and inhibiting the ascending activation system of the reticular structure. Small doses of intravenous injection have sedative and hypnotic effects; when the dose is slightly larger $(3 sim 5 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg})$, the patient can fall asleep within 20 seconds. It can reduce brain metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, reduce cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure. It has a direct effect of inhibiting the myocardium and dilating blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure. The degree of blood pressure reduction is related to the dose and injection speed. In patients with hypovolemia or heart dysfunction, the blood pressure reduction is more significant. It has a strong central respiratory inhibitory effect, which is manifested as a decrease in tidal volume and a slow respiratory rate, or even respiratory arrest. It can inhibit the sympathetic nerves and relatively enhance the parasympathetic nerves, increase the sensitivity of the throat and bronchi, and therefore, stimulation of the larynx, trachea or bronchi can easily cause laryngeal spasm and bronchospasm. It is mainly metabolized and degraded in the liver, and the awakening time after anesthesia may be prolonged in patients with liver dysfunction. end{enumerate} Clinical application: (1) General anesthesia induction: The commonly used dose is $4 sim 6 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$, and endotracheal intubation can be completed with the help of muscle relaxants; (2) Control of convulsions: Intravenous injection of $2.5 %$ solution $1 sim 2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$; 3) Basic anesthesia for children. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Ketamine is a derivative of phencyclidine, which is easily soluble in water, and the $ mathrm{pH}$ of the aqueous solution is $3.5 sim 5.5$. It mainly selectively inhibits the brain communication pathway and the thalamus-neocortical system, excites the limbic system, and has a mild effect on the brainstem reticular formation. The analgesic effect is significant; after intravenous injection, the patient loses consciousness within $30 sim 60$ seconds, and the duration of action is about $15 sim 20$ minutes; it takes effect about 5 minutes after intramuscular injection, and the strongest effect is 15 minutes. It can increase cerebral blood flow, intracerebral pressure and brain metabolic rate. Ketamine has the effect of stimulating the sympathetic nerves, increasing the heart rate, blood pressure and pulmonary artery pressure; and for those with hypovolemic shock and highly excited sympathetic nerves, ketamine can show myocardial depression. The effect on breathing is relatively mild, but excessive dosage or too fast injection speed, or when used in combination with other narcotic analgesics, can cause significant respiratory depression or even respiratory arrest. Ketamine can increase saliva and bronchial secretions and relax bronchial smooth muscles. It is mainly metabolized in the liver, and the metabolite norketamine still has certain biological activity, and the final metabolite is excreted by the kidneys. end{enumerate} Clinical application: The induction dose for general anesthesia is $1 sim 2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ (intravenous injection); the maintenance dose for anesthesia is $15 sim 45 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min}$ ). During basic anesthesia for children, intramuscular injection of $5 sim 10 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ can maintain anesthesia for about 30 minutes. Main side effects: It can cause transient apnea; hallucinations, dreams and mental symptoms; increased intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Etomidate is a short-acting hypnotic with no analgesic effect. Its mode of action is similar to that of barbiturates. It has a rapid onset of action, end{enumerate}\n",
      "{Chapter 5 General Anesthesia} After intravenous injection, the patient's consciousness disappears in about 30 seconds, and the concentration in the brain reaches its peak in 1 minute. It can reduce cerebral blood flow, intramandibular pressure and brain metabolic rate. It has little effect on heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output; it does not increase myocardial oxygen consumption, and has a mild coronary artery dilation effect. The effect on respiration is significantly lighter than that of thiopental sodium. It is mainly hydrolyzed in the liver, and the metabolites are inactive. It has no significant effect on liver and kidney function. Clinical application: It is mainly used for general anesthesia induction, suitable for anesthesia of elderly, weak and critically ill patients, and the general dose is $0.15 sim$ $0.3 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$. Side effects: Myoclonus often occurs after injection; it is irritating to veins; nausea and vomiting are prone to occur after surgery; repeated use or continuous intravenous infusion may inhibit adrenal cortex function. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Propofol (isopropofol) has sedative, hypnotic and mild analgesic effects. It has a rapid onset of action. After intravenous injection of $1.5 sim 2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$, the patient falls asleep within $30 sim 40$ seconds, and the duration is only $3 sim 10$ minutes. After drug withdrawal, the patient wakes up quickly and completely. It can reduce cerebral blood flow, intracerebral pressure and cerebral metabolic rate. Propofol has a significant inhibitory effect on the cardiovascular system, and the degree of inhibition is greater than that of an equivalent dose of sodium thiothal. The main manifestations are direct inhibition of the myocardium and vasodilation, resulting in a significant drop in blood pressure, slow heart rate, peripheral resistance and cardiac output. When large doses are injected quickly, or used in patients with hypovolemia and the elderly, there is a risk of causing severe hypotension. It has a significant inhibitory effect on breathing, manifested as reduced tidal volume and slowed respiratory rate, or even respiratory arrest, and the degree of inhibition is related to the dose. It is metabolized by the liver, and the metabolites are inactive. It accumulates in the body when repeatedly injected or continuously infused intravenously, but has no significant effect on liver and kidney function. end{enumerate} Clinical application: general anesthesia is induced intravenously at a dose of $1.5 sim 2.5 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$. It can be combined with other general anesthetics for anesthesia maintenance by continuous intravenous infusion, with a dosage of $6 sim 10 mathrm{mg} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$. It has great advantages in anesthesia for outpatient surgery, with a dosage of about $2 mathrm{mg} /$ $( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$. Patients can answer questions 10 minutes after stopping the drug. Side effects: It has a stimulating effect on veins; it has a depressive effect on breathing, and artificial assisted breathing should be performed when necessary; the incidence of nausea and vomiting after anesthesia is about $2% sim 5%$. {III. Muscle relaxants} Muscle relaxants (muscle relaxants) are referred to as muscle relaxants. They can block the neuromuscular conduction function and relax skeletal muscles. Since the first clinical application of tubocurarine in 1942, muscle relaxants have become an important part of general anesthesia. However, muscle relaxants can only paralyze skeletal muscles without producing an anesthetic effect. Muscle relaxants not only facilitate surgical operations, but also help avoid the harm caused by deep anesthesia. {(I) Mechanism of action and classification} The neuromuscular junction includes the presynaptic membrane, the postsynaptic membrane, and the synaptic cleft between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. Under physiological conditions, when nerve excitation is transmitted to the motor nerve endings, the vesicles located in the nerve endings rupture, releasing the transmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft and binding to the acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, causing the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize and induce muscle fiber contraction. Muscle relaxants mainly interfere with the normal transmission of neuromuscular excitation at the junction. According to the different interference methods, muscle relaxants can be divided into two categories: depolarizing muscle relaxants and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. begin{enumerate} item Depolarizing muscle relaxants are represented by succinylcholine. The molecular structure of succinylcholine is similar to that of acetylcholine. It can bind to acetylcholine receptors to cause postsynaptic membrane depolarization and muscle fiber bundle contraction. However, succinylcholine has a strong affinity for receptors and is not easily decomposed by cholinesterase at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, its action time is long, which prevents the postsynaptic membrane from repolarizing and keeps it in a state of continuous depolarization. It no longer responds to acetylcholine released by nerve impulses, resulting in muscle relaxation. When the concentration of succinylcholine at the junction gradually decreases, the postsynaptic membrane repolarizes and the neuromuscular conduction function returns to normal. After repeated use of succinylcholine, the muscle cell membrane can gradually repolarize, but the sensitivity of the receptor to acetylcholine decreases, resulting in a prolonged muscle relaxation effect, which is called desensitization block. end{enumerate} Action characteristics: (1) The postsynaptic membrane is in a state of continuous depolarization; (2) After the first injection, before the muscle relaxation effect appears, there may be muscle fiber bundle tremors, which is the result of uncoordinated muscle fiber contraction; (3) Cholinesterase inhibitors not only cannot antagonize its muscle relaxation effect, but have an enhancing effect. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants are represented by tubocurarine. This type of muscle relaxant can bind to the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic membrane, but does not cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. When more than $75% sim 80%$ of the acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane are occupied by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, nerve impulses can cause the release of acetylcholine from nerve endings, but there are not enough receptors to bind to them, and the postsynaptic membrane cannot depolarize, thereby blocking neuromuscular conduction. Muscle relaxants and acetylcholine compete with receptors and have a clear dose-dependency. When cholinesterase inhibitors (such as neostigmine) are used, the decomposition of acetylcholine slows down and the concentration increases, which can repeatedly compete with muscle relaxants for receptors. Once the number of acetylcholine binding to receptors reaches the threshold, it can cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane and muscle contraction. Therefore, the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants can be antagonized by cholinesterase inhibitors. end{enumerate} Action characteristics: (1) The blocking site is at the neuromuscular junction, occupying the acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane; (2) The amount of acetylcholine released by the presynaptic membrane does not decrease when the nerve is excited, but it cannot play a role; (3) There is no muscle fiber bundle contraction before the muscle relaxant effect occurs; (4) It can be antagonized by cholinesterase inhibitors. {(II) Commonly used muscle relaxants} begin{enumerate} item Succinylcholine (succinylcholine, scoline) is a depolarizing muscle relaxant with a rapid onset of action and a complete and short-lived muscle relaxant effect. Muscle fiber tremors appear within $15 sim 20$ seconds after intravenous injection, and the muscle relaxant effect reaches its peak within 1 minute. After intravenous injection of $1 mg/kg, respiratory arrest can last for $4 sim 5 minutes, and it takes about $10 sim 12 minutes for muscle tension to fully recover. The effect on hemodynamics is not obvious, but it can cause a transient increase in serum potassium, and in severe cases, it can lead to arrhythmia. It does not cause histamine release, so it does not cause bronchospasm. It can be rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase, and metabolites are excreted in the urine, with no more than $2% excreted in the original form. It is mainly used clinically for endotracheal intubation during general anesthesia, with a dosage of $1 sim 2 mg/kg, which is injected rapidly through the vein. Side effects are: it may cause bradycardia and arrhythmia; during the process of extensive skeletal muscle depolarization, it can cause an increase in serum potassium; during muscle tonic contraction, it can cause an increase in intraocular pressure, intragastric pressure and intragastric pressure; some patients complain of myalgia after surgery. item Vecuronium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant with strong muscle relaxant effect, which is $1 sim 1.5$ times that of pancuronium, but the duration of action is shorter. The onset time is $2 sim 3$ minutes, and the clinical duration of action is $25 sim 30$ minutes. Its muscle relaxant effect is easily antagonized by cholinesterase inhibitors. Within the clinical dosage range, it has no histamine release effect and no anti-vagal effect, so it is suitable for patients with ischemic heart disease. It is mainly metabolized in the liver, and the metabolite 3-hydroxyvecuronium also has muscle relaxant effect. $30%$ is excreted as the original form through the kidneys, and the rest is excreted as metabolites or the original form through the bile duct. It can be used clinically for general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation, and maintenance of muscle relaxation during surgery. Intravenous injection of $0.07 sim 0.15 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}, 2 sim 3$ minutes later, endotracheal intubation can be performed. Intravenous injection of $0.02 sim$ $0.03 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ can be intermittent during surgery, or intravenous infusion at a rate of $1 sim 2 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ can be used to maintain muscle relaxation during general anesthesia. In patients with severe liver and kidney dysfunction, the duration of action can be prolonged and accumulation can occur. item Rocuronium (rocuronium, Ai Kesong) is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant with a weaker muscle relaxant effect, which is 1/7 of vecuronium; the duration of action is $2 / 3$ of vecuronium, and it is a medium-acting muscle relaxant. The biggest feature (advantage) of rocuronium is that it is the fastest acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in clinical practice. When the dosage is $1.2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$, endotracheal intubation can be performed in 60 seconds, and the onset of action is almost as fast as succinylcholine. Another feature is that there is a specific antagonist that can antagonize any degree of neuromuscular blockade caused by rocuronium. It has no histamine release effect; it has a slight anti-vagal effect, but the clinical dose has no significant effect on the circulation. It is mainly excreted from the bile, and liver failure can prolong its duration of action. It is clinically used for endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia and to maintain muscle relaxation during surgery. After intravenous injection of $0.6 sim$ $1.2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}, endotracheal intubation can be performed 60 sim 90$ seconds later. During surgery, $0.1 sim 0.2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ can be intermittently injected intravenously, or $9 sim 12 mu mathrm{g} /$ $( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ can be intravenously infused to maintain muscle relaxation during general anesthesia. Item Cisatracurium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. The onset time is $2 sim 3$ minutes, and the clinical action time is $50 sim 60$ minutes. The biggest advantage is that it does not cause histamine release within the clinical dose range. The metabolic pathway is Hofmann degradation. It is clinically used for endotracheal intubation during general anesthesia and to maintain muscle relaxation during surgery. After intravenous injection of $0.15 sim 0.2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}, endotracheal intubation can be performed 1.5 sim 2$ minutes later. During the operation, $0.02 mg/kg$ can be injected intermittently or intravenously at a rate of $1 sim 2 mu g/(kg cdot min)$ to maintain muscle relaxation during general anesthesia. end{enumerate} {(III) Precautions for the use of muscle relaxants} begin{enumerate} item An artificial airway (such as endotracheal intubation) should be established, and assisted or controlled breathing should be performed. item Muscle relaxants have no sedative or analgesic effects and cannot be used alone. They should be used under the action of general anesthetics. item The use of succinylcholine can cause a transient increase in serum potassium, intraocular pressure and intraocular pressure; therefore, it is contraindicated for patients with severe trauma, burns, end{enumerate} {Chapter 5 General Anesthesia} paraplegia, glaucoma, and increased intraocular pressure. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Hypothermia can prolong the duration of action of muscle relaxants; inhaled anesthetics, certain antibiotics (such as streptomycin, gentamicin, polymyxin) and dodecanone sulfate can enhance the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. item Patients with concomitant neuromuscular junction diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, are contraindicated in using non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. item Some muscle relaxants have a histamine-releasing effect, so they should be used with caution by patients with a history of asthma or allergic constitution. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{IV. Narcotic analgesics} Narcotic analgesics (narcotics) refer to drugs that can act on the central nervous system to relieve or reduce pain and eliminate emotional reactions caused by pain. The classic representative drug is morphine. The original meaning of opioids (opiates) refers specifically to natural opium alkaloids and semi-synthetic derivatives, while opioids (opioid) refer to natural or synthetic substances that can bind to opioid receptors and cause stimulant effects. Narcotic analgesics are indispensable drugs for general anesthesia. Commonly used drugs are: begin{enumerate} item Morphine (morphine) is an opioid extracted from opium. It acts on the limbic system of the brain to eliminate tension and anxiety, and cause euphoria. It is addictive. It can increase the pain threshold and relieve pain. It has a significant inhibitory effect on the respiratory center. In mild cases, breathing slows down, and in severe cases, tidal volume decreases or even stops breathing. It also has a histamine release effect and causes bronchospasm. Morphine can dilate arterioles and veins, reduce peripheral vascular resistance and reduce the amount of blood returning to the heart, causing a decrease in blood pressure, but it has no significant inhibitory effect on the myocardium. It is mainly used for analgesia, such as severe pain caused by trauma or surgery, angina pectoris, etc. Because morphine has good sedative and analgesic effects, it is often used as a pre-anesthetic drug and an anesthetic adjuvant, and can be combined with hypnotic drugs and muscle relaxants to perform total intravenous anesthesia. The adult dosage is $5 sim 10 mathrm{mg}$ subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. item Fentanyl has similar effects on the central nervous system as other opioids, and its analgesic effect is $75 sim 125$ times that of morphine, lasting for 30 minutes. It has an inhibitory effect on respiration, and the respiratory depression is more obvious when fentanyl is used together with midazolam. The analgesic effect of fentanyl lasts only $20 sim 30$ minutes, and its respiratory depression can reach 1 hour. Clinically used analgesic doses of $(2 sim$ $10 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$) or anesthetic doses of $(30 sim$ 100 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$) rarely cause hypotension. It can be used as an adjuvant during anesthesia ($0.05 sim$ $0.1 mathrm{mg})$, or to relieve cardiovascular reactions during intubation $(2 sim$ 5 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg})$. When fentanyl is combined with intravenous general anesthesia, the dosage is $30 sim$ $100 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$, and it is often used for anesthesia in cardiovascular surgery. item Sufentanil is a derivative of fentanyl, with an analgesic effect 5 to 10 times that of the latter, and the duration is about twice that of the latter. It has a depressant effect on respiration, the degree of which is similar to that of fentanyl at an equivalent dose, but the duration is shorter than that of the latter. It is more lipid soluble than fentanyl, and its pharmacokinetic characteristics are similar to those of fentanyl. Sufentanil has less interference with the circulatory system and is more suitable for anesthesia in cardiovascular surgery. It can also be used as an adjuvant during anesthesia ($5 sim 10 mu mathrm{g}$, intravenous injection), or to relieve cardiovascular reactions during endotracheal intubation $(0.25 sim 0.5 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg})$. item Remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting analgesic. When used alone, it has no obvious effect on circulation, but can significantly slow down the heart rate; when used in combination with other general anesthetics, it can cause a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. A dose of $leqslant 5 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$ will not cause histamine release. It can produce dose-dependent respiratory depression, but spontaneous breathing can be restored 5 to 8 minutes after discontinuation of the drug. The incidence of muscle rigidity is high. For induction and maintenance of anesthesia, the single intravenous injection volume is $0.5 sim 1 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$, and the recommended dose for maintenance of anesthesia is $0.025 sim$ $1.0 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. If the plasma concentration of remifentanil is controlled to be greater than $4 mathrm{ng} / mathrm{ml}$ by target-controlled infusion (TCI), the reaction during endotracheal intubation can be effectively inhibited; the blood concentration for maintenance of anesthesia is $4 sim 8 mathrm{ng} / mathrm{ml}$. Because the analgesic effect disappears quickly after the infusion of remifentanil is stopped, appropriate analgesic measures should be taken before stopping the drug, such as giving a small dose of fentanyl, epidural analgesia, etc. end{enumerate} {Section 2 $ quad$ Implementation of general anesthesia} The general anesthesia process is divided into three stages: anesthesia induction, anesthesia maintenance, and anesthesia awakening. {I. Induction of anesthesia} General anesthesia induction refers to the stage in which the patient, after receiving general anesthetics, goes from a conscious state to a state of unconsciousness, and then enters a state of general anesthesia and undergoes endotracheal intubation. This stage is called the general anesthesia induction period. Although there are two methods for general anesthesia induction: inhalation induction and intravenous induction, it is now advocated to use a combined induction method to utilize the interaction between drugs to achieve the same clinical effect while reducing the dosage, side effects and physiological effects of various drugs. Before induction, the anesthesia machine, endotracheal intubation equipment and suction device should be prepared, the intravenous and gastrointestinal decompression tubes should be opened, the basic values ​​of blood pressure and heart rate should be measured, and the electrocardiogram and pulse oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SpO}_{2} right)$ should be monitored. The methods of inducing general anesthesia are: {(I) Inhalation induction method} begin{enumerate} item Open drip method A wire mesh mask is tied with gauze to the patient's mouth and nose, and volatile anesthetics are dripped on the gauze. When the patient breathes, the volatile anesthetic gas is inhaled and gradually enters the anesthesia state. In the past, it was mainly used for ether anesthesia, but now it is basically abandoned. Only occasionally other inhalation anesthetics are used for the induction of pediatric anesthesia. item Mask inhalation induction method The anesthesia mask is buckled on the patient's mouth and nose, and the anesthetic vaporizer is turned on and the inhalation concentration is gradually increased. When the patient loses consciousness and enters the anesthesia state, muscle relaxants are injected intravenously and endotracheal intubation is performed. end{enumerate} {(II) Intravenous induction method} At the beginning of intravenous induction, pure oxygen is inhaled through a mask for $2 sim 3$ minutes to increase oxygen reserves and expel nitrogen from the lungs and tissues. According to the condition, the appropriate intravenous anesthetic and dosage are selected, and the patient's consciousness, circulation and breathing changes are closely monitored. After the patient loses consciousness, muscle relaxants are injected. When the skeletal muscles and lower jaw gradually relax and the breathing stops from shallow to complete, artificial respiration is performed with an anesthesia mask, and then endotracheal intubation is performed. After successful intubation, the patient is immediately connected to the anesthesia machine and artificial respiration or mechanical ventilation is performed. Compared with the inhalation induction method, intravenous induction is faster, the patient is more comfortable, and there is no environmental pollution; however, the stages of anesthesia depth are not obvious, and the interference to circulation is greater. {II. Maintenance of general anesthesia} Maintenance of general anesthesia is the period from the patient's loss of consciousness to the end or basic end of the operation or examination, when the additional general anesthetic is stopped. The main task of the maintenance period of general anesthesia is to maintain an appropriate depth of anesthesia to meet the requirements of the operation, such as deepening anesthesia during skin incision, and good muscle relaxation is required when opening and closing the peritoneum and exploring the abdominal cavity. At the same time, strengthen the management and regulation of the patient to ensure the stability of physiological functions such as circulation and respiration. begin{enumerate} item Maintenance of inhalation anesthetics A certain concentration of inhalation anesthetics is inhaled through the respiratory tract to maintain an appropriate depth of anesthesia. At present, the gaseous anesthetics for inhalation are nitrous oxide, and the volatile anesthetics are fluorinated anesthetics, such as isoflurane and sevoflurane. Since nitrous oxide has weak anesthetic properties, there is a risk of hypoxia when inhaled at high concentrations, so it is difficult to use it alone to maintain anesthesia. Volatile anesthetics have strong anesthetic properties. Inhalation at high concentrations can make the patient lose consciousness and pain, and can be used alone to maintain anesthesia; but the muscle relaxant effect is not satisfactory, and the higher the inhaled concentration, the more serious the physiological impact. Therefore, in clinical practice, $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}_{-}- mathrm{O}_{2}$-volatile anesthetics are often used together to maintain anesthesia, and muscle relaxants can be added when necessary. When using nitrous oxide, the inhaled oxygen concentration or $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ should be monitored, and the inhaled oxygen concentration should not be less than $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ for safety. Volatile anesthetics should use a dedicated vaporizer to control their inhaled concentration. If conditions permit, the concentration of inhaled and exhaled anesthetics can be continuously monitored to make the depth of anesthesia easier to control. item Maintenance of intravenous anesthetics is a method of maintaining an appropriate depth of anesthesia by administering drugs intravenously after general anesthesia induction. There are three methods of intravenous administration: single, divided and continuous injection. The administration method should be selected according to the needs of the operation and the pharmacological characteristics of different drugs. Among the intravenous anesthetics currently used, most are hypnotic drugs except azamide and lack good analgesic effects. Some drugs, such as thiopental sodium, have a certain analgesic effect during deep anesthesia, but they also have a great impact on physiology. Therefore, a single intravenous general anesthetic is only suitable for general anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance for short operations, while for complex or long operations, combined general anesthesia is often selected. end{enumerate} Due to the individual differences in the response of different patients to intravenous anesthetics, the intensity of stimulation during surgery is constantly changing, and the accumulation of intravenous anesthetics in the body after continuous injection, constant-rate infusion can no longer meet the requirements of clinical anesthesia regulation. With the deepening understanding of the pharmacokinetics of intravenous anesthetics and the application of computer technology in clinical practice, target-controlled infusion (TCI) has been widely used in clinical anesthesia. TCI is an intravenous administration method that applies the principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to control or maintain anesthesia at an appropriate depth by adjusting the drug concentration in the target site (plasma or effect site) during intravenous anesthetic infusion to meet clinical requirements. TCI can adjust the blood drug concentration or effect site concentration at any time according to the intensity of surgical stimulation and the patient's response, and can maintain a stable plasma or effect site concentration that meets clinical requirements. However, the drugs currently used in clinical practice are limited to drugs that are fast, short-acting and have no accumulation effect, such as propofol and remifentanil. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Maintenance of combined general anesthesia refers to the combined use of two or more general anesthetics or (and) anesthesia methods to complement each other to achieve the best clinical anesthesia effect. With the increasing variety of intravenous and inhaled general anesthetics and the continuous improvement of anesthesia technology, the method of using a single anesthetic (such as ether) to achieve all general anesthesia effects is basically no longer used, and combined anesthesia is increasingly widely used in clinical practice. According to the different routes of administration, combined anesthesia can be roughly divided into total intravenous anesthesia and intravenous-inhaled combined anesthesia of intravenous and inhaled anesthetics. end{enumerate} Total intravenous combined anesthesia: also known as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), refers to the use of a variety of short-acting intravenous anesthetics to maintain anesthesia after intravenous anesthesia induction. The analgesic effect of commonly used intravenous anesthetics is very weak. During the anesthesia process, strong narcotic analgesics need to be added to enhance the anesthetic effect and inhibit stress response. In order to achieve the purpose of muscle relaxation, muscle relaxants must be given. Therefore, total intravenous anesthesia is the combined application of intravenous anesthetics, narcotic analgesics and muscle relaxants. This can not only give full play to the advantages of various drugs, but also overcome their adverse effects; it has the advantages of fast induction, simple operation, and avoidance of environmental pollution caused by inhaled anesthetics; if the medication is used at the right time and in the right amount, the anesthesia process can be smooth and the recovery is also faster. However, since it is a combination of multiple drugs, it is very important and difficult to choose the timing and dosage of administration according to the pharmacological characteristics of various drugs. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish the signs of anesthesia and the stages of anesthesia under total intravenous anesthesia, and delayed awakening after anesthesia and the residual effects of muscle relaxants can also bring serious complications. Intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia: The depth of total intravenous anesthesia is difficult to judge, the timing of administration is difficult to grasp, and sometimes the anesthesia can suddenly become shallow. Therefore, low-concentration volatile anesthetics, such as isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane, are often inhaled continuously or intermittently on the basis of intravenous anesthesia. This can not only maintain a relatively stable anesthesia, but also reduce the dosage of inhaled and intravenous anesthetics, which is conducive to rapid awakening after anesthesia. Combined intravenous-inhalation anesthesia has a wide range of applications, and anesthesia operation and management are relatively easy to master. It is rare for anesthesia to suddenly become shallow. {III. Determination of the depth of general anesthesia} The definition of the depth of anesthesia is still controversial. It is generally believed that the state of anesthesia is the comprehensive result of the coexistence of multiple pharmacological effects and noxious stimulation. The depth of anesthesia refers to the degree of influence of anesthetic drugs on the patient's consciousness, sensation, movement, nerve reflexes and internal environment stability. Therefore, the observation of clinical signs is still the basic method for judging the depth of anesthesia. Among electrophysiological methods, the bispectral index (BIS) is more sensitive in judging the degree of sedation of patients.\n",
      "{(I) Clinical judgment of anesthesia depth} In the 1930s, Guedel summarized the various signs and manifestations of ether anesthesia stages. Due to the characteristics of ether itself, the physiological effects are slow, the clinical manifestations are clear and well-organized, and it is easy to understand and master in clinical practice. Although new anesthetics and anesthesia methods are used in clinical practice, the various signs for judging the depth of anesthesia during ether anesthesia have not changed completely. The basic points of ether anesthesia stages can still be used as a reference for judging and mastering the degree of anesthesia in clinical anesthesia today. Ether anesthesia stages are based on the degree of drug inhibition of the patient's consciousness, pain, reflex activity, muscle relaxation, respiration and circulation, and describe the typical general anesthesia process, that is, the inhibition process of the central nervous system by general anesthetics. During compound anesthesia, multiple drugs are used simultaneously to suppress physiological functions in a targeted manner to achieve loss of consciousness or amnesia, disappearance of pain, reflex inhibition and muscle relaxation, without significantly inhibiting hemodynamics. In some cases, due to the use of strong analgesics and muscle relaxants, the patient may not have any pain reaction and the muscles may be completely relaxed. However, the patient may know what is happening during the operation but cannot express it. This is called intraoperative awareness, which indicates that the patient's consciousness has not completely disappeared. Therefore, the depth of anesthesia should be comprehensively judged based on the degree of influence of the combined drugs (including various general anesthetics, tranquilizers, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, analgesics, etc.) on consciousness, sensation, movement, nerve reflexes and internal environment stability. For example, for patients with spontaneous breathing, increased and accelerated breathing during surgical stimulation is a manifestation of shallow anesthesia. \"Watery\" tears are a manifestation of shallow anesthesia, while dry and dull cornea is a manifestation of too deep anesthesia. The stability of circulation is still an important sign for judging the depth of anesthesia. Severe circulatory inhibition is mostly due to too deep anesthesia, while increased heart rate and blood pressure are mostly manifestations of shallow anesthesia. Volatile anesthetics have strong anesthetic properties. Although large amounts of inhalation can make patients lose consciousness and pain, the muscle relaxant effect is not satisfactory. If you blindly pursue muscle relaxant, you will inevitably pay the price of deep anesthesia. Therefore, compound anesthesia still depends on reasonable drug compatibility to avoid deep anesthesia. The pain will disappear when the alveolar concentration of inhaled anesthetics reaches $1.3 mathrm{MAC}$, and the patient can wake up when it is below $0.3 mathrm{MAC}$. Maintaining an appropriate depth of anesthesia is important and complex. The patient should be closely observed, and a reasonable judgment should be made based on various reactions. The depth of anesthesia should be adjusted in time according to the strength of surgical stimulation to meet the needs of surgical anesthesia. In clinical practice, anesthesia is usually divided into light anesthesia period, surgical anesthesia period and deep anesthesia period according to clinical signs (Table 5-2), which is of reference significance for mastering the depth of anesthesia. Table 5-2 Common clinical criteria for judging the depth of anesthesia begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} hline Anesthesia stages & Suction & Ring & Sign & Other hline Light anesthesia stage & begin{tabular}{l} Irregular, choking, airway resistance, laryngeal spasm end{tabular} & Blood pressure $ uparrow$, heart rate $ uparrow$ & begin{tabular}{l} Eyelash reflex $(-)$, eyelid reflex $(+)$, eye movement $(+)$, tearing end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Swallowing reflex $(+)$, sweating, secretions $ uparrow$, body movement during stimulation end{tabular} hline Surgical anesthesia stage & Regular, airway resistance $ downarrow$ & begin{tabular}{l} Blood pressure is slightly low but stable, no change during surgical stimulation end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Eyelid reflex $(-)$, eyeball fixed in the center end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} No body movement when stimulated, mucosal secretions disappear end{tabular} hline Deep anesthesia & muscular respiration, breathing $ uparrow$ & blood pressure $ downarrow$ & begin{tabular}{l} Light reflex (-), pupil dilation end{tabular} & hline end{tabular} end{center} {(II) Electrophysiological methods for measuring the depth of anesthesia} In terms of monitoring patient consciousness, the bispectral index (BIS) is widely used in clinical practice. BIS is a method that uses the principle of nonlinear phase locking to regress the original electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform. The BIS value range is $0 sim 100$. The larger the value, the more conscious the patient is, and vice versa, it indicates that the inhibition of the cerebral cortex is more severe. At present, it is believed that when the BIS value is controlled below 60 during anesthesia, the incidence of intraoperative awareness is very small. Therefore, it is recommended that the BIS be controlled at $40 sim 60$ during anesthesia. Monitoring BIS can better reflect the inhibitory effect of hypnotic drugs on the CNS, but it is less sensitive to the effect of analgesics. Therefore, in the clinical application of BIS monitoring, the hypnotic component and the analgesic component of anesthesia should be treated differently. When BIS is elevated but there is no body movement response and hemodynamic response, hypnotic drugs should be added, and when BIS is low but there is still hemodynamic and body movement response, analgesics should be added to increase the analgesic component in anesthesia. However, the threshold value of BIS can be affected by the combined use of multiple anesthetics, which is its limitation. Therefore, BIS can provide useful trend information for anesthesia depth monitoring, but it cannot completely prevent the occurrence of awareness during anesthesia when used alone. {IV. Awakening from anesthesia} Awakening from anesthesia is the period from the cessation of additional general anesthetics to the complete recovery of the patient's consciousness. Since it takes a certain amount of time to recover from anesthesia, and there are many complications during this period, in order to ensure the safety of patients, patients after general anesthesia should be sent to the anesthesia recovery room for close observation, and sent back to the general ward after they are fully awake and their vital signs are stable. {(I) Recovery from inhalation anesthesia} Recovery from inhalation anesthesia requires that the inhaled anesthetic be excreted from the body through the respiratory tract. This pharmacokinetic process is basically the opposite of the induction and deepening process of inhalation anesthesia. Therefore, under the premise of ensuring that there is no inhaled anesthetic in the inhaled air, anesthesiologists can speed up the excretion of inhaled anesthetics through the respiratory system by increasing alveolar ventilation. After stopping inhaled anesthetics, the main factors affecting the recovery speed of inhaled anesthesia are: begin{enumerate} item Blood/gas partition coefficient of the drug The smaller the blood/gas partition coefficient, the faster the recovery. item Anesthesia time The shorter the time, the faster the recovery. item Alveolar ventilation Within a certain range, the larger the alveolar ventilation, the faster the recovery. end{enumerate} {(II) Awakening from intravenous anesthesia} Awakening from intravenous anesthesia depends on the redistribution, biotransformation and excretion of the drug in the body. The patient will not begin to wake up until the concentration of the anesthetic in the central nervous system drops to a certain level. There is currently no effective way to actively intervene and regulate. Factors that affect the speed of awakening from intravenous {Chapter 5 General Anesthesia} anesthesia are: begin{enumerate} item Half-life of the drug The shorter the half-life, the faster the awakening. The time it takes for the blood drug concentration to decrease by half after a single dose is expressed by the distribution half-life $left(mathrm{t}_{1 / 2} alpha right)$ and the elimination half-life $left(mathrm{t}_{1 / 2} beta right)$. If awakening from intravenous anesthesia that can be completed with a single dose is required as soon as possible, drugs with short distribution half-life and elimination half-life should be selected. item Anesthesia time and drug dosage The longer the time and the larger the total amount of drug used, the slower the awakening from anesthesia. In order to maintain an appropriate depth of anesthesia, repeated administration or continuous intravenous infusion is often required during surgery. Since most drugs accumulate to a certain extent in the body after repeated and continuous administration, the law of blood drug concentration reduction can no longer be accurately reflected by the distribution half-life or elimination half-life, but is related to the context-sensitive half-time (context-sensitive half time, $ mathrm{t}_{1 / 2} mathrm{cs}$) of continuous intravenous infusion. $ mathrm{t}_{1 / 2} mathrm{cs}$ represents the time it takes for the blood drug concentration to decrease by half after a certain period of continuous constant-rate infusion of the drug. The shorter the $t_{1 / 2} mathrm{cs}$, the faster the awakening. item Factors affecting drug metabolism and excretion For example, if a drug is mainly metabolized by the liver, patients with impaired liver function will awaken more slowly; if the prototype of a certain anesthetic or its anesthetic metabolites are mainly excreted by the kidneys, patients with impaired renal function will awaken more slowly; low temperature can reduce the metabolic rate of all drugs, and anesthesia awakening will also be prolonged. end{enumerate} {Section 3 Complications of general anesthesia and their treatment} {(I) Reflux and aspiration} Reflux and aspiration are prone to occur during general anesthesia, especially in obstetric and pediatric surgery patients. The consequences vary depending on the nature and amount of the refluxed or aspirated material. The mortality rate of aspirating a large amount of gastric contents can be as high as $70%$. During the induction of general anesthesia, aspiration can occur once there is refluxed material because the patient loses consciousness and the throat reflex disappears. Whether the aspirated material is solid food or gastric juice, it can cause acute airway obstruction. Complete airway obstruction can immediately lead to suffocation and hypoxia, endangering the patient's life. Aspiration of gastric juice can cause lung damage, bronchospasm and increased capillary permeability, resulting in pulmonary edema and atelectasis. The degree of lung injury is related to the amount of gastric juice and $ mathrm{pH}$. The greater the amount of inhaled gastric juice and the lower the $ mathrm{pH}$, the more severe the lung injury; the risk is significantly increased when the $ mathrm{pH}$ is lower than 2.5 and the volume is greater than $ mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$. It is very important to prevent reflux and aspiration during anesthesia. The main measures include: reducing the retention of gastric contents, promoting gastric emptying, increasing the $ mathrm{pH}$ of gastric juice, reducing intragastric pressure, and strengthening the protection of the respiratory tract. {(II) Airway obstruction} The respiratory tract is divided into upper and lower respiratory tracts with the glottis as the boundary. The upper respiratory tract is above the glottis (including the glottis), and the lower respiratory tract is below the glottis. The common causes, clinical manifestations and treatments of upper and lower airway obstruction are detailed in \"Chapter 6 Airway Management\" of this book. {(III) Hypoventilation} Hypoventilation may occur during and after anesthesia, mainly manifested by $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention, which may be accompanied by hypoxemia. Blood gas analysis shows that $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is higher than $ mathrm{mmHg}$, and $ mathrm{pH}$ is less than 7.30. Injury from cranial surgery and the residual effects of general anesthetics, narcotic analgesics and sedatives are the main causes of central respiratory depression. Mechanical ventilation should be used to maintain breathing until respiratory function is fully restored, and antagonists should be used to reverse it if necessary. The residual effects of postoperative muscle relaxants can lead to hypoventilation, and breathing should be assisted or controlled until respiratory muscle strength is fully restored. Antagonists should be given if necessary. {(IV) Hypoxemia} When breathing air, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}<90 %, mathrm{PaO}_{2}<60 mathrm{mmHg}$, or when breathing pure oxygen, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<90 mathrm{mmHg}$, it can be diagnosed as hypoxemia. Clinical manifestations include tachypnea, cyanosis, restlessness, tachycardia, arrhythmia, and increased blood pressure. Common causes and treatment principles are: 11 Anesthesia machine failure and insufficient oxygen supply can cause low oxygen concentration; endotracheal tube insertion into one bronchus or out of the trachea and respiratory obstruction can cause hypoxemia, which should be discovered and corrected in time. (2) Diffuse deficiency: It can be seen in $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ inhaled anesthesia. After stopping the inhalation of $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$, oxygen inhalation should be continued for at least 5 to 10 minutes. (3) Atelectasis: It can be corrected by suctioning sputum, increasing ventilation, and lung re-expansion. (4) Aspiration: Oxygen therapy is effective for mild cases, and mechanical ventilation should be performed for severe cases. (5) Pulmonary edema: It can occur in acute left heart failure or increased pulmonary capillary permeability. The primary disease should be actively treated while increasing the concentration of inhaled oxygen. {(V) Hypotension} If the systolic blood pressure drops by more than $30%$ of the baseline value or the absolute value is less than $80 mathrm{mmHg}$ during anesthesia, it should be treated promptly. Common causes are: (1) Too deep anesthesia can lead to a drop in blood pressure and a narrowing of pulse pressure. If the patient has hypovolemia before anesthesia, the symptoms are more obvious. (2) Excessive blood loss during surgery can cause hypovolemic shock. (3) Allergic reactions, adrenal cortical insufficiency and rewarming can all cause a decrease in vascular tone and lead to hypotension. Treatment includes blood volume supplementation, restoration of vascular tone (use of vasoconstrictors) and etiological treatment. (4) During surgery, traction of internal organs can often cause a reflex drop in blood pressure and bradycardia. Stimulation should be relieved in a timely manner, and atropine should be given if necessary.\n",
      "{(VI) Hypertension} If the diastolic blood pressure is higher than $100 mathrm{mmHg}$ or the systolic blood pressure rises by more than $30%$ of the baseline value during anesthesia, appropriate treatment should be given according to the cause. Common causes include: (1) related to coexisting diseases, such as primary hypertension, pheochromocytoma, increased intracranial pressure, etc.; (2) related to surgery and anesthesia operations, such as surgical exploration, endotracheal intubation, etc.; (3) insufficient ventilation causing $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation; (4) drug-induced hypertension, such as ketamine. Treatment principles: analgesics such as fentanyl can be combined during endotracheal intubation to reduce cardiovascular reactions during intubation; the depth of anesthesia can be adjusted according to the degree of surgical stimulation; for patients with refractory hypertension, controlled hypotension can be performed to maintain circulatory stability. {(VII) Arrhythmia} When sinus tachycardia and hypertension occur simultaneously, it is often a manifestation of shallow anesthesia, and anesthesia should be appropriately deepened. In the presence of hypovolemia, anemia and hypoxia, the heart rate may increase, and treatment should be targeted at the cause. When surgery stretches the internal organs (such as the gallbladder, which can cause gallbladder-cardiac reflex) or an oculocardiac reflex occurs, bradycardia may occur due to the vagal reflex, and in severe cases, cardiac arrest may occur. The surgical operation should be stopped immediately, and atropine should be injected intravenously if necessary. When premature contractions occur, their nature should be clarified first and their effects on hemodynamics should be observed. Ventricular premature contractions caused by shallow anesthesia or $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation can usually be relieved by appropriately deepening anesthesia or expelling $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$. If ventricular premature contractions are multi-source, frequent, or accompanied by R-on-T phenomenon, it indicates myocardial insufficiency and should be treated actively. {(VIII) High fever, convulsions and seizures} are common in pediatric anesthesia. Since the temperature regulation center of infants and young children is not yet fully developed, their body temperature is easily affected by the ambient temperature. If high fever is not treated in time, it may cause convulsions or even seizures, and physical cooling should be actively carried out. Malignant hyperthermia is manifested by continuous muscle contraction, rapid increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, and a sharp rise in body temperature (the speed can reach $1^{ circ} mathrm{C} / 5 mathrm{~min}$), which can exceed $42^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. The drugs that are most likely to induce malignant hyperthermia are succinylcholine and halothane. The incidence of malignant hyperthermia is slightly higher in European and American countries, while it is relatively rare in China, but the mortality rate is very high, so vigilance should be increased. The specific drug for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene. {Chapter 6 Airway Management} In clinical anesthesia and emergency treatment of critically ill patients, establishing and maintaining a complete and unobstructed airway is the prerequisite for ensuring normal ventilation and oxygenation of patients, and is also a prerequisite for ensuring patient safety and subsequent treatment. Airway control technology is not only a basic technique that anesthesiologists must master, but also a basic skill that clinical physicians in other departments must possess when dealing with critically ill patients, especially physicians in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency department. {Section 1 Factors that affect airway patency} {1. Structure of the airway} The respiratory system consists of two parts: the airway and the lungs. The airway can be divided into the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. Clinically, the mouth, nose, pharynx and larynx are called the upper respiratory tract (Figure 6-1); the trachea, bronchi and their branch bronchi at all levels in the lungs are called the lower respiratory tract. Among them, the mouth, nose and pharynx are also common passages between the respiratory system and the digestive system. Problems in any of the above anatomical structures may cause airway obstruction. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-083} end{center} Figure 6-1 Schematic diagram of the upper respiratory tract section begin{enumerate} item Collar and mouth The anatomical structure of the collar and face is closely related to the airtightness during mask-assisted ventilation and the operation of endotracheal intubation. Too small mouth opening, retraction of the lower jaw, thin and sunken cheeks, and a protruding nose may increase the difficulty of operation. Anatomical abnormalities of the oral cavity and teeth are also closely related to the difficulty of intubation. For example, an overly large tongue, growths or tumors in the oral cavity, missing teeth, residual teeth, long or protruding incisors, and complete edentulism can increase the difficulty of mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. item Nose The nose is the beginning of the respiratory tract, where the inhaled air is usually humidified and warmed; the nasal hair and mucus can also act as a filter to block dust and fine particles in the air. During quiet breathing, $2 / 3$ of the airway resistance is caused by airflow passing through the nose. The airway resistance when breathing through the nose is almost twice that of breathing through the mouth, which is also an important reason why humans usually choose to breathe through the mouth during strenuous exercise. The top of the nasal cavity, especially the mucosa of the anterior and superior area of ​​the nasal septum, has a very rich vascular plexus from the branches of the superior marginal artery. This area is also called the nose-prone bleeding area (also known as the Little area). More than $90%$ of nosebleeds related to catheterization injuries occur in this area. When inserting a nasal tube, it is strictly forbidden to enter the upper nasal meatus with an endotracheal tube or gastrointestinal drainage tube to avoid uncontrollable damage and bleeding. Common causes of nasal airway obstruction include: nasal polyps, nasal septum distortion, nasal membrane edema and increased secretions caused by inflammation, etc. item Pharynx The pharynx is a funnel-shaped muscular tube that connects the posterior nasal aperture and extends to the upper end of the esophagus and the vicinity of the piriform fossa. The pharynx can be artificially divided into the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx by the lower edge of the soft palate and the upper edge of the epiglottis. The main causes of airway obstruction in the nasopharynx and oropharynx are enlarged tonsils and tongue drop caused by relaxation of the genioglossus muscle, respectively. item Larynx The larynx is located between the 3rd and 6th cervical vertebrae. Its main functions are to produce sound and protect the lower airway. The larynx is composed of muscles, ligaments, and cartilages. The cartilages include the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, epiglottic cartilage, and three pairs of cartilages (arytenoid cartilage, corniculate cartilage, and cuneiform cartilage), and their surfaces are covered by the umbilicus. The muscles of the larynx are very active and are mainly innervated by branches of the vagus nerve. Intubation stimulation or manipulation of the larynx can cause laryngeal spasm, which is also a common cause of airway obstruction. Item Trachea and main bronchi As shown in Figure 6-2, the trachea is usually composed of $12 sim 20$ horseshoe-shaped cartilage rings, generally $15 sim$ 16. The length of the adult trachea is $10 sim 15 mathrm{~cm}$, with an average of about $10.5 mathrm{~cm}$. The upper part starts at the cricoid cartilage (equivalent to the level of the 6th cervical vertebra), and the lower part ends at the tracheal carina (equivalent to the lower edge of the 4th thoracic vertebra, at the level of the sternal angle). The trachea is divided into the left and right main bronchi downward. There are abundant vagus nerve fiber endings distributed on the surface of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa, especially at the tracheal carina, which can easily cause severe coughing and bronchospasm when stimulated. The main causes of tracheal and bronchial obstruction are: airway secretions or foreign bodies, invasion or compression of huge neck tumors, and severe bronchospasm. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-084} end{center} Figure 6-2 Trachea and bronchus {II. Common causes affecting anatomical airway patency} Compared with artificial airways such as endotracheal tubes, the body's own airway belongs to the anatomical airway. Clinically, any factor that can cause airway stenosis or obstruction from the oropharynx to the bronchi is a cause that affects anatomical airway patency. Common causes include: begin{enumerate} item Secretions, bleeding, and foreign bodies Secretions, blood clots, and foreign body obstruction are common causes of airway obstruction in emergency patients, and are more likely to occur in patients who are unconscious. When there is a lot of secretion in the throat or foreign matter, it often causes incomplete airway obstruction, which manifests as inspiratory dyspnea. When auscultating, sputum and high-pitched wheezing can be heard in the patient's larynx and (or) chest. end{enumerate} Treatment principle: Clear secretions or foreign matter as soon as possible. Before the airway is unobstructed, efforts should be made to preserve the patient's cough reflex and spontaneous breathing to prevent secretions or foreign matter from migrating to the lower respiratory tract, thereby causing complete airway obstruction. When there is too much secretion or blood in the throat, it should be sucked out in time with a negative pressure suction device; when foreign matter or blood clots block the airway, the patient's tongue can be pulled out and cleaned by hand or other auxiliary instruments; when exposure or operation is difficult, foreign matter can be sucked out or removed under direct laryngoscope to restore airway patency. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Retrognathia is the most common cause of clinical airway obstruction. It often occurs in patients with unclear consciousness, during the induction and recovery period of general anesthesia, and when sedatives are used as adjuvant analgesics in patients without general anesthesia. When the patient is in the supine position, the lower jaw and gaioglossus relax under the action of gravity, which can cause the tongue to fall to the posterior pharyngeal wall and block the airway. When retrognathia causes incomplete airway obstruction, the most obvious manifestation is the gurgling sound of varying strengths and laryngeal dragging sign emitted with breathing; when retrognathia causes complete airway obstruction, the cursing sound disappears, and the patient will show obvious abnormal chest and abdominal breathing, three-recess sign, and complete interruption of respiratory airflow in the mouth and nose in the early stage, followed by a progressive decrease in $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and cyanosis, etc., which must be treated urgently. end{enumerate} Treatment principles: You can use the one-handed lifting method or the two-handed holding method, or place an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway (see Section 2 of this chapter for details). begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Laryngeal spasm Laryngeal spasm is caused by increased irritability of the pharynx and increased excitability of the vagus nerve that controls the larynx, which causes the glottis to close and activity to increase. It often occurs during intubation during general anesthesia induction or postoperative awakening and extubation, especially during light anesthesia or hypoxia and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation, when laryngeal manipulation is more likely to induce laryngeal spasm. The clinical manifestations are inspiratory dyspnea, which may be accompanied by a dry cough and a typical high-pitched inspiratory stridor. In mild laryngeal spasm, only the false vocal cords contract, the glottis narrows, and laryngeal sounds occur during inspiration; in moderate laryngeal spasm, both the true and false vocal cords contract, but the glottis is not completely closed, and laryngeal sounds occur during both inspiration and expiration; in severe laryngeal spasm, the glottis is tightly closed, the airway is completely obstructed, breath sounds disappear, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ drops rapidly, and the patient becomes cyanotic. end{enumerate} Treatment principles: Prevention should be emphasized, and stimulation of the laryngeal membrane should be avoided under hypoxia and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation or light anesthesia. Mild laryngeal spasm can usually be relieved by itself after the stimulation is removed; moderate laryngeal spasm requires oxygen administration by mask pressure, and short-acting anesthetics are used to deepen anesthesia and assist ventilation when necessary; for severe laryngeal spasm, anesthesia must be deepened very quickly, and muscle relaxants can even be added to relieve spasm, and emergency endotracheal intubation is performed to relieve obstruction when necessary; when the situation is more critical or anesthetic drugs and equipment are not available, cricothyroid membrane puncture can be performed urgently with a thick needle or other sharp instruments, and then endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy can be prepared. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Bronchospasm is often caused by allergies, aspiration of vomitus, excessive secretions, and endotracheal intubation or foreign body irritation of the tracheal membrane. The clinical manifestations are characterized by expiratory dyspnea, the patient's expiratory period is prolonged and labored, and auscultation of both lungs is full of wheezing, often accompanied by sinus tachycardia or even more serious arrhythmias. In the most serious cases, the patient's lung airflow is completely interrupted, and the wheezing sound disappears when auscultating the lungs, resulting in \"silent lungs\". During mechanical ventilation, the most notable feature is a significant increase in airway pressure, which may even make ventilation difficult. end{enumerate} Treatment principles: Mild bronchospasm can be relieved by oxygen inhalation or oxygen pressure administration by mask. Moderate to severe cases generally require drug treatment, such as albuterol (Salbuterol) or ipratropium (Atrovent) aerosol inhalation, intravenous injection or nebulized glucocorticoids. Patients with acute bronchospasm during the perioperative period are often patients with a history of asthma or airway hyperresponsiveness. Too shallow anesthesia is the most common cause. Therefore, deepening anesthesia in a timely manner can often achieve twice the result with half the effort. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Ventilatory dysfunction caused by residual effects of drugs In addition to the neuromuscular system lesions that can lead to restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, the overdose, accumulation or residual effects of anesthetics and muscle relaxants that can inhibit the central nervous system can also cause patients' ventilatory dysfunction, manifested as hypoxemia and hypercapnia. end{enumerate} Treatment principles: For mild cases, a simple ventilator or anesthesia machine mask can be used to assist breathing, and for severe cases, endotracheal intubation should be used to assist/control breathing. At the same time, specific antagonists of anesthetics and muscle relaxants can be used in a targeted manner, such as flumazenil, naloxone and neostigmine. {Section 2 Methods for maintaining airway patency} There are currently many methods that can be used to control the airway. According to the different conditions of the patients, when choosing which method to control the airway, the basic principle to follow is: choose the simplest, most effective, safest method that is familiar to the operator. In clinical practice, except for patients under general anesthesia who undergo endotracheal intubation in the operating room, most patients who need emergency airway treatment are outside the operating room, and it is difficult to call an anesthesiologist to come to the scene to treat the airway within a few minutes. At this time, if the clinician passively waits for professional physicians to establish an artificial airway, the patient often loses precious time for treatment. At this time, some simple airway clearing, manual assisted ventilation and simple artificial airway establishment methods can often play an immeasurable role. {I. Basic methods for maintaining airway patency}\n",
      "{(I) Single-handed lifting and lowering method and double-handed jaw-lifting method} These two methods are the simplest and most effective methods to relieve mechanical upper airway obstruction caused by tongue prolapse, and are also basic methods that all clinical workers need to master. begin{enumerate} item Single-handed jaw-lifting method As shown in Figure 6-3A, the patient takes a supine position, the operator tilts the patient's head back, and lifts the chin upward from the lower jaw with one hand, trying to lift the patient's tongue away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, thereby relieving the airway obstruction caused by tongue prolapse. This method has many limitations in clinical use. When the patient has a short head and neck, obesity, nasal obstruction, clenched teeth, and neck stiffness, it is often difficult to work. At this time, it is necessary to consider using the double-handed jaw-lifting method or other methods. item Hand-held collar lift method As shown in Figure 6-3B, the patient lies in a supine position, the operator stands at the head of the patient, tilts the patient's head slightly backward, places the index or middle finger of both hands on the posterior branch of the patient's collar angle, and lifts the collar forward and upward. In order to effectively lift the patient's tongue away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, the height of the patient's lower incisors should be as high as possible to exceed the upper incisors (commonly known as \"underbite\"). includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-086(1)} end{enumerate} Figure 6-3 Manual method to maintain airway patency A. Single-handed collar lift method; B. Hand-held collar lift method {(II) Use of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways} If it takes a long time to relieve the obstruction or the manual lifting method is ineffective, an oropharyngeal airway or nasopharyngeal airway can be placed to help open the airway. begin{enumerate} item An oropharyngeal airway is a hollow artificial airway made of metal, hard rubber or hard plastic, with a J-shaped appearance (Figure 6-4). end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-086} end{center} Figure 6-4 Placement of an oropharyngeal airway Operation method: Select an airway of appropriate size according to the patient's body shape. Insert the front end of the airway (with the concave side facing the head end) into the patient's mouth toward the side of the head, and then rotate the airway $180^{ circ}$ while pushing the airway into the pharyngeal cavity. This method can avoid pushing the tongue into the deep part of the mouth during the process of pushing the airway, which may cause difficulty in tube placement. Alternatively, the airway can be placed in the oropharynx after pressing the tongue with a tongue depressor or laryngoscope. At this time, the curvature of the oropharyngeal airway fits the natural curvature of the patient's tongue. Notes: (1) When awake or lightly anesthetized patients use oropharyngeal airways, they may experience reflexes such as nausea, vomiting, choking, laryngospasm and bronchospasm. Therefore, it is only suitable for patients who are not awake or have appropriate anesthesia depth; (2) If the airway is placed in an inappropriate position, it will push the tongue root deep into the pharyngeal cavity and aggravate the obstruction or cause laryngospasm, tongue and pharyngeal injury, etc.; (3) If the patient cannot open his mouth and it is not appropriate to use a nasopharyngeal airway, two tongue depressors can be placed between the upper and lower posterior molars on both sides, and the mouth can be opened by the action of the tongue lever before the oropharyngeal airway is placed. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item The nasopharyngeal airway is a soft hollow tube made of rubber or plastic, about $15 mathrm{~cm}$ in length, and similar in appearance to a tracheal tube. The front end of the ventilator is short and blunt, without a cover. It is mainly used to relieve upper airway obstruction caused by retroglossiformis, especially for patients with masseter spasm (Figure 6-5). Since patients tolerate it well, nausea, vomiting and laryngeal pain are less likely to occur. Since the ventilator is inserted through the patient's nostril and the tube diameter is large, it is easy to cause bleeding. Therefore, it is contraindicated for patients with abnormal coagulation function, nasopharyngeal fracture, nasopharyngeal infection or nasal septum trauma displacement. end{enumerate} Operation method: (1) Choose a patency side of the nostril for insertion. Before insertion, drip an appropriate amount of vasoconstrictor, such as ephedrine, into the nasal cavity to reduce the risk of nasal bleeding. (2) Apply a medical lubricant (catheter glue) containing local anesthetic to the surface of the ventilator. (3) The insertion length of the ventilator is generally the distance from the tip of the nose to the external auditory canal, so that the front end of the ventilator is just above the epiglottis. (4) The ventilation tube must be inserted along the inferior nasal meatus, and the insertion direction must be kept completely perpendicular to the face. It is strictly forbidden to point it towards the nose. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-087} end{center} Figure 6-5 Place the nasopharyngeal ventilation tube and insert it in the top direction to avoid injury and bleeding. (5) The insertion action should be gentle and slow. If there is resistance, it should not be inserted forcefully. The tube can be slightly rotated until there is no resistance before continuing to push it forward. {II. Mask ventilation} Mask ventilation technology is a basic skill that clinical physicians at all levels must master. Its equipment requirements are simple, easy to operate, and the ventilation effect is accurate. It can also provide high-concentration oxygen therapy. In the absence of obvious airway obstruction, its ventilation effect is similar to that of endotracheal intubation. The patient has good tolerance and can cooperate to complete the ventilation operation without deep anesthesia. Therefore, it still plays an irreplaceable role in emergency airway management and critical care. begin{enumerate} item Indications (1) General anesthesia ventilation for short surgeries without the risk of gastric reflux and aspiration; (2) Pre-oxygenation and denitrification for patients before endotracheal intubation; (3) Assisted or controlled breathing in emergency situations, such as first aid for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. end{enumerate} {2. Operation method} (1) Preparation of items: Choose a transparent ventilation mask of appropriate size so that the mask can fit tightly against the bridge of the nose, cheeks and mouth, and the color and secretions of the lips can be observed. Check the balloon, connect it to the oxygen supply tube, and ensure that there is no leakage. Appropriate oropharyngeal ventilation tubes, nasopharyngeal ventilation tubes, and negative pressure suction devices should be available. (2) Mask placement: When operated by one person, the operator holds the mask with the left hand, lifts the lower collar corner with the little finger, places the middle finger and ring finger on the lower collar bone, and places the index finger and thumb on the mask. Use appropriate force to maintain the airtightness of the mask; the right hand controls the balloon to perform manual ventilation (Figure 6-6A). If the patient's head and face are large and the mask is difficult to seal, two people may be required to operate. At this time, the operator maintains the mask in a good position with both hands, and the assistant controls the balloon (Figure 6-6B, C). A four-head strap can also be used to help fix the mask to the patient's face. The requirements are to ensure that the mask fits tightly to the patient's face without obvious air leakage, and to be able to relieve airway obstruction caused by tongue drop by lifting the lower collar corner. (3) Key points for assisting or controlling breathing: When the operator assists or controls breathing with his right hand or an assistant, he should judge the amplitude of the patient's chest rise and fall and the size of the ventilation resistance by observation or touch, and evaluate the ventilation effect. The ventilation effect can be improved by tilting the patient's head slightly back, lifting the buttocks or holding up the lower collar, so that the patient's lower collar bone is lifted forward and upward and the mouth is opened (Figure 6-6). If necessary, an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal ventilation tube can be placed. The time for blowing a tidal volume of $(6 sim 8 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg})$ is generally not less than 1 second. Slow and even air supply can minimize the occurrence of gastric distension. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Precautions Since the artificial airway is not tightly connected to the lower respiratory tract during face mask ventilation, the following precautions should be taken when using it: end{enumerate} (1) The airway must be completely cleared of secretions, blood, and foreign matter, otherwise there is a risk of aggravating airway obstruction under positive pressure ventilation. (2) During face mask ventilation, there is a risk that gas will enter the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the risk of reflux aspiration in patients. (3) Face mask ventilation is often ineffective or ineffective for lower respiratory tract obstruction. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Common complications The most common complication is soft tissue compression around the mouth, eyes, or nose caused by prolonged face mask ventilation, while reflux aspiration of gastric contents is the most serious complication. Keeping the patient calm and/or cooperative, and controlling ventilation pressure and tidal volume are the most effective measures to prevent reflux aspiration. includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-088} end{enumerate} Figure 6-6 Mask ventilation technique {III. Tracheal intubation} Tracheal intubation can usually be divided into two categories: endotracheal intubation and bronchoal intubation. Endotracheal intubation is the most reliable method to connect the artificial airway with the anatomical airway, and is also one of the basic skills that anesthesiologists and emergency physicians (including ICU physicians) must master.\n",
      "{(I) Endotracheal intubation} begin{enumerate} item Indications Endotracheal intubation can keep the patient's airway open, prevent foreign objects from entering the airway, facilitate the timely suction of endotracheal secretions or blood, perform effective artificial or mechanical ventilation, and facilitate the inhalation of general anesthetics. Therefore, endotracheal intubation should be performed for patients who cannot keep their airways open during general anesthesia (such as internal surgery, thoracotomy, prone surgery, etc.), patients who have difficulty keeping their airways open due to illness (such as swelling and paralysis compressing the trachea), patients who have obvious respiratory inhibition by general anesthetics or who use muscle relaxants. Patients who need mechanical ventilation for various reasons, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and severe neonatal asphyxia are all indications for endotracheal intubation. item Preparation before intubation Before intubation, all equipment and instruments must be in place and function normally, personnel must be in place, and relevant drugs (anesthetics, vasoactive drugs, etc.) must be prepared. Insufficient preparation before intubation or insufficient anticipation of difficult airways may not only lead to intubation failure, but may also threaten the patient's life. Commonly used instruments include: laryngoscope, endotracheal tube, dental pad or mouth gag, topical anesthesia sprayer, connecting tube, tube core, intubation forceps, fixing tape and negative pressure suction device, etc. end{enumerate} (1) Examination and assessment of patients before intubation: Before intubation, patients should be routinely examined and evaluated, and the difficulty of endotracheal intubation should be understood. The patient's previous surgical anesthesia history is of great reference value for judging the difficulty of intubation. (2) Selection and examination of laryngoscope: There are many types of direct laryngoscopes available clinically, and their uses and methods of use are also different. They should be selected according to the operator's usage habits and the patient's condition. At present, the most commonly used is still the most traditional Macintosh laryngoscope (curved laryngoscope blade). For adult endotracheal intubation, No. 3 or No. 4 Macintosh laryngoscope is often used. Before use, check whether the battery of the laryngoscope is fully charged and whether the light bulb or optical fiber at the front end of the laryngoscope blade is bright. (3) Selection and inspection of endotracheal tube: Adults generally choose endotracheal tubes with an inner diameter of $7.0 to 7.5 mm. The inner diameter of endotracheal tubes for children can be selected according to the empirical formula, that is, the inner diameter of the tube $(mm)=$ the age of the child $($ years old $) / 4+4$. After selecting the tube, two additional tubes with an inner diameter of $0.5 mm larger and smaller than the inner diameter of the tube should be prepared to adjust the model of the endotracheal tube in time according to the actual situation of the patient during intubation. Check whether the tube sheath is leaking, and lubricate the front end of the tube with medical lubricant or saline; place the tube core in the endotracheal tube cavity, and maintain the appropriate curvature of the endotracheal tube according to the position of the patient's throat to improve the success rate of intubation. The front end of the tube core cannot exceed the endotracheal tube. (4) Preparation and verification of drugs: According to the patient's condition, select and prepare appropriate anesthetic drugs and auxiliary drugs, including sedatives, hypnotics, narcotic analgesics and muscle relaxants. Drugs used during anesthesia must be verified before use. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Endotracheal intubation method According to whether the glottis needs to be exposed during intubation, it can be divided into visual intubation and blind intubation; according to the intubation route, it can be divided into oral intubation and nasal intubation; according to the anesthesia method before intubation, it can be divided into slow induction intubation, rapid induction intubation and awake intubation. end{enumerate} (1) Oral visual endotracheal intubation 1) Pre-oxygenation and denitrification: Before intubation, the patient breathes pure oxygen through a mask for at least 3 minutes to expel nitrogen from the patient's body, increase oxygen reserves in the lungs, and extend the safe time limit of intubation. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Intubation position: Three anatomical axes can be drawn from the patient's mouth to the trachea: the oral axis is the axis from the oral cavity to the posterior pharyngeal wall $( mathrm{OA})$, the pharyngeal axis is the axis from the posterior pharyngeal wall to the larynx (PA), and the laryngeal axis is the axis from the laryngeal cavity to the upper trachea (LA). When the patient lies on his back, these three axes intersect each other at an angle and are not in a straight line. If a thin pillow is placed under the patient's pillow to raise the patient's head by about $10 mathrm{~cm}$, and the head is tilted back (\"flower sniffing position\"), the three axes of the patient's pharynx, mouth, and larynx can be made to overlap, and the intubation path can be made to be close to a straight line, which is conducive to exposing the glottis (Figure 6-7). end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-089} end{center} A includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-089(1)} Figure 6-7 Schematic diagram of head position during endotracheal intubation A. In supine position, the three axes are at angles to each other; B. After the pillow is raised by about $10 mathrm{~cm}$, PA and LA are close to overlapping, but still have a clear angle with OA; C. When the pillow is raised by about $10 mathrm{~cm}$ and the head is tilted back (\"flower sniffing position\"), the angle of the three axes becomes smaller and close to overlapping, making it easier to use laryngoscope to reveal the glottis begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Intubation method: The operator holds the handle of the laryngoscope with his left hand, lifts the chin with his right hand, opens the mouth and spreads the upper and lower lips. Place the laryngoscope blade from the right corner of the patient's mouth, slide it down along the back of the patient's tongue, and press the tongue slightly to the left while gradually moving the laryngoscope blade to the middle of the mouth. After the uvula is exposed, continue to slide the laryngoscope blade down gently along the curve of the back of the tongue until the epiglottis cartilage is seen. When using a curved laryngoscope blade, insert the front end of the laryngoscope blade into the epiglottic valley between the root of the tongue and the root of the epiglottic cartilage under clear vision, and then move it upward and slightly forward. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-090(3)} end{center} A begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-090(2)} end{center} C begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-090(1)} end{center} B begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-090(2)} end{center} textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-090} end{center} Figure 6-8 Macintosh laryngoscope (curved blade) operation diagram Lift the laryngoscope upward to make the epiglottis wing upward and close to the laryngoscope blade to expose the glottis (Figure 6-8). If a straight laryngoscope blade (such as Miller laryngoscope) is used, after exposing the epiglottis cartilage, place the blade on the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis cartilage and lift the epiglottis directly forward and upward to expose the glottis. Note that when lifting the laryngoscope, the direction of the force should be consistent with the direction of the laryngoscope handle, that is, toward the ceiling above the patient's feet, roughly $45^{ circ}$ in the front and upper part. At this time, be careful not to bend your wrist or move the laryngoscope blade on the patient's teeth to avoid damaging the teeth or soft tissues. When inserting the tube, hold the tracheal tube with your right hand like a pen. Insert the tracheal tube along the right corner of the patient's mouth while looking at the glottis clearly. Avoid blocking the operator's field of vision with the tube, and do not let your teeth scratch the tube sheath. After the tracheal tube enters the glottis, pull out the tube core inside the tube and continue inserting the tube until the sheath of the tracheal tube enters the position $3 sim 4 mathrm{~cm}$ below the vocal cords. Then insert the dental pad between the patient's incisors and withdraw the laryngoscope. Use a syringe to inflate the tube sheath. The best inflation standard is to make the pressure inside the sheath the minimum pressure when there is no air leakage around the sheath under manual breathing. The average depth of tube insertion for adults (i.e. the distance from the front end of the tracheal tube to the incisors) is $18 sim 22 mathrm{~cm}$. 4) Determination of the position of the tracheal tube: The ideal position of the tube should be in the middle of the trachea, $3 sim 7 mathrm{~cm}$ above the tracheal carina. Common methods for confirming the position of the endotracheal tube include: (1) Connecting the endotracheal tube to a $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ detector or an end-expiratory $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ monitor, and performing several artificial ventilations to detect the $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the airway; the appearance of a normal $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ waveform is a reliable indicator that the endotracheal tube is in the trachea. (2) Place a stethoscope on the chest area and mid-axillary line on both sides of the patient in turn, and listen to and observe whether the breath sounds and chest rise and fall amplitude of both lungs are consistent during positive pressure ventilation. If the breath sounds of one lung of the patient disappear after intubation, it indicates that the tube may be too deep and enter the other main bronchus. The tube needs to be withdrawn slowly until the breath sounds of both lungs are symmetrical. (3) If conditions permit, a chest X-ray can be used to determine the position of the tube. Make sure that the front end of the marking line on the tube is in the middle of the trachea and does not enter one bronchus. However, this method cannot reliably determine whether the tube is located in the esophagus. 5) Fixation of endotracheal tube: It is best to use a dedicated tube fixator to fix the tube; tape or endotracheal tube fixation band can also be used to fix the tube. After intubation, ICU patients should be given appropriate sedatives and their upper limbs should be restricted to prevent them from accidentally removing the tube. 6) Precautions: (1) During intubation, the patient should be in an appropriate depth of anesthesia to relax the masseter muscles, open the mouth satisfactorily, and suppress the pharyngeal reflex; (2) If the pharyngeal reflex is found to be active during exposure, the intubation should be suspended and the anesthesia should be appropriately deepened under assisted ventilation; surface anesthesia of the throat can be performed for awake intubation; (3) The point of force of the laryngoscope should always be at the top of the laryngoscope blade, and the technique of lifting the laryngoscope should be used. It is strictly forbidden to use the upper incisors as a fulcrum to prevent damage to the teeth; (4) When inserting the tube into the glottis, the action must be gentle and violence should be avoided. (2) Nasotracheal intubation 1) Indications: Similar to oral visual endotracheal intubation. It is especially suitable for some special patients who are not suitable for oral endotracheal intubation, such as those with unstable cervical spine, mandibular fracture, oropharyngeal infection, and those who need to wear the tube for a long time. 2) Contraindications: The degree of trauma of this operation is higher than that of oral endotracheal intubation. The main contraindications are for patients with coagulation dysfunction, mid-face trauma, chin base fracture, and possible increased intracranial pressure. 3) Key points of operation: Nasal endotracheal intubation includes two methods: nasal endotracheal intubation and blind exploration. When performing nasal endotracheal intubation, the operation of the laryngoscope is similar to that of oral endotracheal intubation. Choose the nostril with better ventilation for intubation. The endotracheal tube should be fully lubricated with medical lubricant, and surface anesthesia should be applied in the nasal cavity, and several drops of $3%$ ephedrine should be instilled to shrink the nasal mucosal blood vessels and reduce the risk of bleeding. When inserting the tube, pay attention to the endotracheal tube being placed in the incision perpendicular to the face and intubated along the inferior nasal meatus to avoid injury and uncontrollable bleeding. When it is difficult to insert the catheter into the glottis, the intubation forceps can be used to assist in the placement of the tube. Nasal blind endotracheal intubation is a method of blindly inserting the tube through the patient's respiratory airflow after the catheter is placed in the nasal cavity while retaining the patient's spontaneous breathing. It was previously used for patients who needed endotracheal intubation because of difficulty or inappropriate laryngoscopy exposure. This method requires the operator to have rich intubation experience, and the success rate is difficult to guarantee. It is not suitable for beginners. In recent years, with the increasing maturity and promotion of auxiliary intubation technologies such as fiberoptic bronchoscopes, the use of this method in clinical practice has gradually decreased. {(II) Endobronchial intubation} Endobronchial intubation is a method of placing a bronchial tube into the bronchus below the tracheal carina to establish artificial ventilation of one or both lungs. Its purpose is to separate the two lungs for separate ventilation and to remove secretions from the two lungs separately. It is mainly used for patients with hemoptysis, lung abscess or cyst, other lung or esophageal surgery, and bronchoalveolar lavage to protect the non-surgical lung function or improve the quality of exposure of the intrathoracic surgical field. Endobronchial intubation requires a special bronchial tube. There are two main types of bronchial tubes: double-lumen bronchial tubes (divided into left-side tubes and right-side tubes) and Univent tubes. Double-lumen bronchial tube models include $28 sim 41 mathrm{~F}$ (generally $39 sim 41 mathrm{~F}$ for adult males and $35 sim 37 mathrm{~F}$ for females), and each model has a double-lumen bronchial tube specifically for the left or right side. In most cases, the operation can be completed using a left-side double-lumen bronchial tube to reduce the risk of the right upper lobe bronchus being blocked by the tube. However, many scholars advocate the use of a double-lumen endobronchial tube on the non-surgical side, which can ensure that the tube will not interfere with the surgical operation that requires main bronchectomy, and can also avoid the surgical operation pulling on the hilum of the lung and affecting the position of the endobronchial tube.\n",
      "{(III) Common complications of endotracheal intubation} begin{enumerate} item Trauma caused by endotracheal intubation Endotracheal intubation may cause damage to the lips, tongue, teeth, throat or tracheal membrane, and may occasionally cause cricoarytenoid joint dislocation or vocal cord injury. As long as the operation is careful and violence is avoided, it will generally not occur or the symptoms are mild. item Obstructed endotracheal tube Twisted endotracheal tube, excessive inflated tube air blocking the tube opening, head twisting in prone position, excessive head tilting back, etc., which makes the front end of the tube close to the tracheal wall, and the inner diameter of the tube joint is too thin, etc., may lead to incomplete or complete airway obstruction. At this time, prevention should be done according to the cause. Once it occurs, if it cannot be relieved after treatment, fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be used to clarify the cause and give corresponding treatment, or the endotracheal tube can be replaced immediately. item Excessive sputum or sputum blockage Excessive sputum or sputum blockage of the endotracheal tube is common in children or patients with long-term indwelling tubes. For patients with long-term indwelling catheters, sputum suction should be performed regularly and airway humidification should be performed to prevent the formation of phlegm diarrhea. A large amount of secretions or sputum can be retained in the gap between the trachea and the catheter above the inflatable cuff. Once the cuff is deflated, it may flow into the airway and cause airway obstruction, so it should be cleaned regularly. item Insertion of endotracheal tube too deep can block one bronchus Insertion of endotracheal tube too deep can easily lead to the mistake of inserting one bronchus and leaving the other bronchus without ventilation, especially when the position of the head changes after intubation, and when laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum surgery causes the diaphragm and trachea to rise. The best diagnostic method is to auscultate the breath sounds of both lungs and observe the breathing movements of both sides of the chest. Once this happens, the position of the endotracheal tube should be adjusted in time. item Failure of anesthesia machine or ventilator Failure of the valve of anesthesia machine or ventilator, detachment of the tube, excessive condensation of humidified water in the tube of the ventilator blocking the airway, and other mechanical factors can all cause airway obstruction. It is very important to detect and deal with it in time, and replace the anesthesia machine or ventilator if necessary. end{enumerate} {IV. Tracheotomy} Tracheostomy is to open the lower respiratory tract by cutting the cervical trachea, and a metal or silicone tracheotomy tube can be placed to relieve upper respiratory tract obstruction. This is a common surgical procedure to establish a patent artificial airway and is one of the emergency skills that clinical physicians should master, especially anesthesia and critical care physicians. At present, in addition to traditional tracheotomy, the available tracheotomy methods include cricothyroidotomy, cricothyroidotomy and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT). Its main indications include: (1) acute upper airway obstruction caused by various reasons, such as acute laryngitis, severe laryngeal spasm and foreign body obstruction of the upper airway; (2) severe trauma to the oral, collar and facial area, making it impossible to perform endotracheal intubation; (3) failure of endotracheal intubation caused by various reasons, especially when an unforeseen difficult airway occurs; (4) retention or obstruction of sputum or secretions in the lower airway, in order to facilitate timely airway cleaning and maintain lower airway patency; (5) the need to maintain an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation for a long time. Common complications of tracheotomy include: subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema, bleeding, airway obstruction, laryngeal nerve damage, esophageal damage or even tracheoesophageal fistula, vocal cord damage, subglottic stenosis and tracheal stenosis. {(I) Conventional tracheotomy} begin{enumerate} item Preoperative preparation In addition to the standard tracheotomy kit, oxygen, negative pressure suction device, tracheotomy tube, simple breathing skin or ventilator and various emergency medicines should also be prepared. For patients who do not need emergency tracheotomy, endotracheal intubation and oxygen therapy can be considered first, and tracheotomy can be performed after the breathing difficulty is relieved. item The body position is generally supine, with the shoulders and neck properly raised, so that the head is tilted back and the trachea is as close to the skin as possible, which is convenient for surgical exposure and operation. Routine disinfection of the neck, drape or hole towel. item Anesthesia For patients under general anesthesia or with severe impaired consciousness, anesthesia is not necessary. Others often use local infiltration anesthesia, and the block range is from the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage to the suprasternal fossa. item Operation method Generally, two people operate, make a midline straight incision in the neck, and cut the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage to the suprasternal fossa. Use a vascular clamp to bluntly separate the sternohyoid muscle and sternothyroid muscle along the midline to expose the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Pull the isthmus of the thyroid gland upward, or cut and suture the isthmus to expose the tracheal rings. Generally, use a sharp blade to cut two tracheal rings from bottom to top at the $2-4$ tracheal ring; use a curved vascular clamp to open the tracheal incision, and insert a tracheotomy tube of appropriate size; pull out the tube core, aspirate the blood and secretions in the surgical field and trachea, and check for obvious bleeding. Connect the tracheotomy tube to the ventilator for mechanical ventilation or maintain open airway for spontaneous breathing. Use the tie on the tube to wrap around the neck to fix the incision tube. Be careful not to fix it too tight or too loose to avoid compressing the neck blood vessels or accidentally removing the incision tube. Skin incisions generally do not need to be sutured, and a sterile gauze pad can be covered between the skin incision and the tube. end{enumerate} {(II) Cricothyroidotomy} This method is an emergency measure only in cases of acute and severe upper airway obstruction. Generally, a large-caliber intravenous cannula or metal needle is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane. During puncture, the needle body forms an angle of $30^{circ}$ with the patient's skin, and the needle tip points to the patient's foot. When a clear sense of empty space is felt and air is withdrawn, indicating that the needle tip has entered the trachea, the needle core can be withdrawn and the cannula needle can be left in the trachea. High-frequency jet ventilation or rapid ventilation with a small tidal volume technique can be performed through the cannula needle. This method can only be used as an emergency treatment measure for difficult airways, and conventional tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation should be prepared and performed as soon as possible. {(III) Cricothyroidotomy} Similar to cricothyroidotomy, cricothyroidotomy is usually also used as an emergency measure to relieve upper airway obstruction, and conventional tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation should be prepared and performed as soon as possible. During the operation, the patient is placed in the same position as that of conventional tracheotomy. A transverse skin incision of about $2 sim 4 mathrm{~cm}$ is made between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage. The cricothyroid membrane is cut near the cricoid cartilage, and the incision is enlarged with a curved vascular needle. At this time, the upper airway obstruction can be relieved, and a tracheotomy tube or endotracheal tube of appropriate size is inserted through the cricothyroid membrane incision, and mechanical ventilation can be performed by connecting it to a ventilator or anesthesia machine. {(IV) Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy} At present, in most hospitals in China, traditional tracheotomy still needs to be performed by specialists (such as otolaryngologists) and requires special surgical instruments and catheters, which greatly limits its application in emergency difficult airway treatment. In order to meet the needs of the development of anesthesia and critical care medicine, a variety of minimally invasive percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy kits for clinical selection have been developed in the past decade. Figure 6-9 shows the basic components of the percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy kit. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-093} end{center} Figure 6-9 Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy kit A. Puncture trocar and syringe; B. Guide wire; C F. Dilators of different diameters, from small to large; G. Tracheotomy cannula Operation method Make a transverse skin incision of about $1 mathrm{~cm}$ in length at the middle of the anterior neck between the $1 sim 2$ or $2 sim 3$ tracheal rings; Use the puncture trocar to puncture the trachea vertically downward in the middle of the incision; When the puncture needle has a clear sense of falling empty and the syringe is backdrawn to see air, withdraw the needle core and insert the guide wire into the trachea through the trocar; Withdraw the trocar and leave the guide wire in the trachea; Use dilators of different diameters to bluntly dilate the puncture path from small to large through the guide wire; withdraw the dilator, insert the tracheotomy tube through the guide wire and leave it in the trachea. After confirming that the tracheotomy tube has entered the trachea, pull out the guide wire and inflate the tracheotomy tube. The airway cleaning and tube fixation methods are the same as those for tracheotomy. Some percutaneous dilatation tracheotomy kits use a special curved vascular clamp to bluntly dilate along the guide wire after the guide wire is placed, and then the tracheotomy tube is placed. For skilled operators, this method can establish an artificial airway more quickly. Percutaneous dilatation tracheotomy has the advantages of being simpler, faster, safer and less invasive because it does not require cutting the tracheal cartilage rings or surgically separating the anterior neck tissue layer by layer. The risk of complications such as vocal cord injury, severe bleeding, airway stenosis and esophageal injury after surgery is also significantly reduced.\n",
      "{V. Application of laryngeal mask airway} The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a special-shaped ventilation tube, mostly made of silicone or plastic. Since its first clinical application in 1983, it has been widely used in clinical practice, and has been gradually expanded from being used for difficult airway management to airway management in clinical anesthesia and critical care medicine. At present, there are various types and models of laryngeal masks, and the appropriate laryngeal mask can be selected according to different patients, clinical needs, personal habits and experience. begin{enumerate} item Advantages of laryngeal mask (1) Easy to carry (2) Easy to learn the operation method; 3) Little stimulation to the larynx, and can be inserted into the patient who is properly sedated while maintaining spontaneous breathing; (4) Low incidence of choking, laryngeal spasm, etc.; (5) The possibility of accidental insertion into the esophagus is extremely low; (6) Can better avoid or reduce vocal cord and airway damage; (7) No special auxiliary equipment or devices are required, and it is generally inserted by blind exploration; (8) Airway resistance is often lower than that of endotracheal intubation. item Limitations of laryngeal mask As a supraglottic ventilation technology, the laryngeal mask itself cannot completely control the airway, so it has certain limitations in use. The main ones include: (1) It is difficult to completely avoid the occurrence of reflux aspiration; (2) When the airway pressure is too high or the tube is not placed in a good position, there is a risk of gastric dilatation or leakage; (3) The incidence of airway obstruction is relatively high, mainly due to the laryngeal mask pushing the epiglottis and causing it to deform or curl; (4) Long-term use can cause compressive damage to the throat, Even epiglottal edema and airway obstruction may occur; (5) Some patients may experience temporary dysarthria after surgery. Indications for item laryngeal mask As new laryngeal masks continue to emerge and their clinical application scope continues to expand, the indications for laryngeal mask airway are still expanding. At present, its main indications include: (1) surgical anesthesia without the risk of reflux aspiration, especially patients with unforeseen difficulties in endotracheal intubation; (2) patients with unstable cervical spine, when endotracheal intubation requires moving the head and there are great concerns; (3) patients who need artificial ventilation or retain spontaneous breathing during short surgeries; (4) timely establishment of artificial ventilation during emergency airway treatment and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Contraindications for item laryngeal mask Mainly include: (1) patients with a full stomach, high intra-abdominal pressure, and a high risk of reflux aspiration; (2) patients with too small mouth opening $(<2.5 sim 3.0 mathrm{~cm})$; (3) patients with lesions such as throat infection, edema, active bleeding, hemangioma and tissue damage; (4) Patients with airway stenosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease whose ventilation pressure needs to be greater than $25 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$. Item Method of placing laryngeal mask Due to the large number of types of laryngeal masks, the placement methods vary slightly. This article only takes the classic laryngeal mask (LMA-classic) as an example to briefly introduce the placement method of the laryngeal mask. The LMA-classic laryngeal mask has a flat and long concave (spoon-shaped) cuff connected to the front end of its ventilation tube. After the cuff is inflated, its size is just enough to cover the larynx, thereby connecting the artificial airway to the patient's natural airway (larynx and lower respiratory tract). There are generally six models, $1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4$ and 5, which are suitable for newborns, infants, children and adults respectively. The laryngeal mask model used in the corresponding recommended weight range is mostly selected according to the patient's weight. end{enumerate} (1) Before placing the tube, check whether the connection of each part of the laryngeal mask is reliable and whether the cuff is leaking. Lubricate the back of the laryngeal mask spoon-shaped sleeve for later use. Since the laryngeal mask does not enter the trachea, it is less irritating to the patient and can be inserted under moderate sedation and surface anesthesia of the throat. For those who cannot cooperate, muscle relaxants can be used for insertion. (2) Blind exploration is generally used for placement. The patient lies on his back. The operator pushes the lower collar or lower lip with his left hand to open the patient's mouth. The laryngeal mask is held in the right hand with the mask opening facing the patient's lower collar. The laryngeal mask is pushed down along the midline of the tongue against the posterior wall of the pharynx until it encounters resistance and cannot be pushed further. The laryngeal mask should not be inserted into the mouth in a vertical manner to avoid the laryngeal mask being folded or curled and making it difficult to maintain the correct insertion direction. After insertion, the mask is inflated and checked to see if it is in the right position. (3) Determination of the position of the laryngeal mask: The best position for the laryngeal mask should be: the front end is located at the bottom of the hypopharynx, close to the anterior wall of the upper esophageal sphincter, the two sides are located in the piriform sinus, and the upper edge of the spoon-shaped cuff is close to the root of the tongue, pushing it forward. At this time, the epiglottis should be located in the spoon-shaped depression of the laryngeal mask, and the ventilation port in the mask is facing the glottis (Figure 6-10). Generally, a preliminary judgment is made by connecting an anesthesia machine or a breathing bag to perform positive pressure ventilation. If the chest rises and falls well and there is no obvious air leakage in the throat during percutaneous auscultation, it usually indicates that the laryngeal mask is in a good position. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is the most accurate method to determine the position of the laryngeal mask. However, even if the position of the laryngeal mask is not good, as long as there is no obvious air leakage and increased airway resistance, good ventilation can usually be maintained. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-094} end{center} Figure 6-10 Correct position of laryngeal mask (4) Adjustment of the position of the laryngeal mask: After the laryngeal mask is placed, if there is air leakage, its position should be adjusted in time: (1) Move the laryngeal mask back a certain distance, re-insert the tube and inflate it appropriately. Over-inflation will increase the risk of air leakage; (2) Adjust the flexion of the patient's head and neck; (3) Gently press the patient's thyroid cartilage; (4) Replace with a larger laryngeal mask; (5) Choose a different type of laryngeal mask; (6) If air leakage is still obvious, consider endotracheal intubation. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{5} item Common complications of laryngeal mask (1) Oropharyngeal discomfort and pain after tube removal, which can usually recover on their own; (2) Long-term indwelling, high cuff pressure or poor mask position can cause temporary dysarthria, laryngeal edema, glottic obstruction, etc.; (3) Reflux aspiration of gastric contents is the most serious complication, which is often related to laryngeal mask air leakage and excessive airway pressure. Double-tube laryngeal mask with drainage tube (such as LMA-Proseal) can be placed in the gastrointestinal drainage tube for drainage. end{enumerate} {VI. Application of esophageal-tracheal combitube} The esophageal-tracheal combitube (ETC) is a double-lumen, double-air-stuff tube with dual functions of esophageal obstructive ventilation tube and conventional endotracheal intubation. It was originally used mainly for pre-hospital emergency care, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency airway management in difficult airways. Compared with conventional endotracheal intubation and laryngeal mask airway ventilation techniques, it has the advantages of being easy to use and quick to place, and can reliably reduce the risk of aspiration of gastric contents reflux, and has become one of the effective measures for emergency treatment of difficult airways. begin{enumerate} item Structure of ETC ETC is a double-lumen catheter made of silicone or plastic (Figure 6-11), with a set of cavities at the distal end that can be inflated to about $10 sim 15 mathrm{ml}$, and a set of cavities at the proximal end that can be inflated to about $100 mathrm{ml}$. One of the cavities reaches the distal end of the catheter and is open, called the tracheal cavity; the other cavity forms a blind end at the proximal end of the distal cuff, and there is a side hole between the two cuffs, called the esophageal cavity. After the ETC is placed, the position of the catheter can be determined by auscultation. When the catheter enters the esophagus, ventilation can be performed through the esophageal cavity with the help of the opening between the cuffs, and breath sounds can be heard in both lungs; when the catheter enters the trachea, ventilation can be performed directly through the tracheal cavity, and the pharyngeal cuff can be deflated. There is a marking line on the catheter about $8 mathrm{~cm}$ away from the proximal cuff. When the marking line is flush with the incisors, it indicates that the intubation depth is appropriate. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-095} end{center} Figure 6-11 Esophageal-tracheal combined tube A.

ETC insertion method} (1) Preparation before use: Carefully check the ETC to ensure that the catheter is not damaged; Check whether the two cuffs are leaking, damaged, or the cuff is bulging; After the inspection, try to exhaust the gas in the cuff; Use catheter glue to fully lubricate the outer wall of the catheter. (2) Operation method: The patient lies flat without a pillow and tilts the head back appropriately. The operator lifts the lower palate with the left hand to open the mouth and spread the upper and lower lips; with the right hand, hold the ETC like a pen and insert the catheter into the mouth along the surface of the tongue in the midline of the oral cavity; push the ETC along the direction until the mark line is flush with the patient's front teeth, and stop the catheter placement. Inflate the proximal and distal sleeves with about $100 mathrm{ml}$ and $15 mathrm{ml}$ respectively. (3) Test of the catheter position: First, connect the esophageal cavity of the ETC to the anesthesia machine, perform intermittent positive pressure ventilation manually, and determine the position of the catheter by auscultation or monitoring $ mathrm{ETCO}_{2}$. Auscultate the breath sounds of both lungs and the gas-water sounds in the upper abdomen. If the breath sounds of both lungs are clear and symmetrical, the chest rises and falls well, no sound of air passing through the upper abdomen can be heard, and a normal $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ waveform can be monitored, it means that the ETC tracheal tube is located in the patient's esophagus, and mechanical ventilation can be performed through the esophageal cavity. If no breath sounds of both lungs are heard and no $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ waveform is monitored, the tracheal cavity should be connected to the anesthesia machine for positive pressure ventilation. If breath sounds of both lungs can be heard and a $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ waveform can be monitored, it means that the tracheal cavity of the catheter has entered the trachea, and mechanical ventilation can be performed through the tracheal cavity. (4) Common complications of ETC: including: soft tissue injury and bleeding, esophageal tear or even perforation, vocal cord injury, etc., and in rare cases, serious consequences such as arterial rupture, pneumothorax and death from esophageal suffocation may occur. Therefore, gentle movements should be emphasized during the operation. When it is difficult to place the tube, other methods should be used in time to avoid serious complications. {Section 3 Treatment of difficult airway} Difficult airway is a common and very critical situation in clinical anesthesia and critical care medicine practice. According to statistics, $30% to 50%$ of serious anesthesia-related complications are related to airway management. Therefore, mastering the relevant knowledge and treatment process of difficult airway is of great clinical significance. The content of this section is mainly compiled based on the \"Expert Opinion on Difficult Airway Management\" formulated by the Anesthesiology Branch of the Chinese Medical Association in 2009. {I. Definition and Evaluation of Difficult Airway} {(I) Definition of Difficult Airway} Difficult airway refers to a clinical situation in which experienced anesthesiologists (generally referring to anesthesiologists with more than 5 years of clinical anesthesia experience) encounter difficulties in mask ventilation (upper airway obstruction), or difficulty in endotracheal intubation, or both. Generally, it includes two situations: difficult mask ventilation and difficult endotracheal intubation. begin{enumerate} item Difficult mask ventilation refers to the inability of experienced anesthesiologists to maintain normal oxygenation and/or appropriate ventilation for patients without the help of others, and the inability to maintain the patient's $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ above $ 90 %$ when using mask pure oxygen positive pressure ventilation. item Difficult endotracheal intubation refers to the difficulty in intubation using direct laryngoscopy. Generally, it includes two situations: (1) No part of the glottis can be seen under conventional laryngoscopy exposure; (2) Under conventional laryngoscopy exposure, the intubation time exceeds 10 minutes or more intubation attempts fail. end{enumerate} Clinically, when only endotracheal intubation is difficult but there is no difficulty with mask ventilation, it is defined as non-emergency airway. Because at this time, most patients can maintain appropriate ventilation and oxygenation, and anesthesiologists have sufficient time to consider using other techniques to establish an artificial airway. Patients with difficulty in mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation are defined as emergency airway. Because the patient may enter a state of hypoxia within a few minutes, an artificial airway must be established urgently.\n",
      "{(II) Assessment of difficult airway} Assessment of airway before anesthesia is very important, which is conducive to selecting appropriate anesthesia induction methods and endotracheal intubation techniques, and avoiding the occurrence of emergency airway. Although there is no reliable method that can completely accurately predict difficult airway, about $90%$ of difficult airway can be identified through assessment before anesthesia induction. Clinical assessment is mainly carried out from the following aspects: begin{enumerate} item Medical history Understand the patient's medical history, especially whether there is trauma, inflammation, deformity and tumor near the airway and its treatment or surgery history, anesthesia history and difficult airway history, whether there is laryngeal striae, intention or obstructive sleep apnea, epistaxis history, etc. item General physical examination Check for obesity, protruding or loose incisors, small lower jaw, short and thick neck, ankylosis of the pre-collar joint; whether there are tongue, cavity, collar face, neck lesions and tracheal displacement. For those who plan to intubate through the nose, it is also necessary to check the nasal ventilation and whether there are nasal lesions. end{enumerate} {3. Special examination} (1) Mouth opening: Mouth opening refers to the distance between the upper and lower incisors when the mouth is opened to the maximum. The normal value is $3.5 sim 5.6 mathrm{~cm}$; less than $3 mathrm{~cm}$, endotracheal intubation may be difficult; less than $1.5 mathrm{~cm}$ or unable to open the mouth often makes it difficult to insert a laryngoscope. Even if a laryngoscope can be inserted, the glottis is not well exposed, which may cause a difficult airway. (2) Thyromental distance: The thyromental distance refers to the distance between the thyroid notch and the inferior maxillary process when the patient's head is tilted back to the maximum limit. The normal value is $geqslant 6.5 mathrm{~cm}$; when the distance is $6 sim 6.5 mathrm{~cm}$, intubation may be difficult; less than $6 mathrm{~cm}$, the probability of difficult intubation is high. (3) Neck range of motion: Neck flexion and extension refers to the range of motion from the patient's maximum flexion to extension of the neck. The normal value is greater than $90^{circ}$; the range from the neutral position to the maximum backward position of the neck can reach $35^{circ}$. If the neck flexion and extension is less than $80^{circ}$, intubation is often difficult. (4) Relative size of the tongue and pharynx: A tongue that is too large or a pharyngeal fold that is too small will affect direct laryngoscopy to reveal the glottis. It can usually be assessed by the modified Mallampati test: the patient sits upright, facing the examiner, with the head in the neutral position, and opens the mouth and extends the tongue to the maximum extent. It is divided into four levels according to the visibility of the pharyngeal structure: Level I: the soft palate, pharyngeal palate arch, and uvula are visible; Level II: the soft palate and pharyngeal palate arch are visible, and the uvula is partially covered by the tongue root; Level III: only the soft palate is visible; Level IV: the soft palate is not visible. Endotracheal intubation is generally not difficult for patients with grades I to II, but is often difficult for patients with grades III to IV. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Radiological imaging examinations Anteroposterior and lateral images of the neck and chest (such as X-ray, CT and MRI) are helpful in identifying difficult airways and their possible causes. end{enumerate} {II. Treatment of difficult airways} According to different treatment procedures, the treatment of difficult airways is generally divided into two categories: anticipated difficult airways and unexpected difficult airways. {(I) Process for treating anticipated difficult airways} Anticipated difficult airways are usually treated according to the steps shown in Figure 6-12. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-097} end{center} Figure 6-12 Schematic diagram of the process of treating an anticipated difficult airway begin{enumerate} item Inform the patient and his/her family clearly of the risks of a difficult airway and have them sign an informed consent form. item Airway management should be performed by an anesthesiologist who has experience in treating difficult airways, with assistants participating. item The preferred and alternative options for endotracheal intubation should be determined before anesthesia, and corresponding preparations should be made. Try to use the methods and instruments that the anesthesiologist is most familiar with. item Use oxygen and nitrogen inhalation with a mask before airway treatment to prolong the patient's tolerance to no ventilation. item Awake endotracheal intubation is the preferred method to prevent an anticipated difficult airway from becoming an emergency airway. item After mild sedation, analgesia and adequate surface anesthesia (including surface anesthesia for endotracheal cricothyroidotomy), try to expose the glottis with a laryngoscope. If the glottis can be exposed, endotracheal intubation can be performed directly; if the glottis cannot be exposed well, intubation can be performed using conventional laryngoscope combined with intubation bougie (when at least the epiglottis can be seen under the laryngoscope), light stick, fiberoptic bronchoscope or blind nasal exploration; video laryngoscope or intubation type laryngeal mask can also be used for intubation. item During the difficult airway treatment process, the primary goal is to ensure the patient's life safety, closely monitor $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$, and ensure the patient's ventilation and oxygenation. item If intubation is still unsuccessful after more than 3 attempts, anesthesia should be abandoned and surgery should be postponed, and airway treatment should be performed again after summarizing experience. end{enumerate} {(II) Unexpected difficult airway treatment process} Unexpected difficult airways are usually treated according to the steps shown in Figure 6-13. begin{enumerate} item It is recommended to administer drugs in two steps during rapid anesthesia induction. First, use an experimental amount of general anesthetic to make the patient unconscious; before injecting the main general anesthetic induction drug and muscle relaxant, a mask ventilation test should be routinely performed to determine whether controlled ventilation can be implemented with the help of a mask. For those who find it difficult to control ventilation with the help of a mask, the use of muscle relaxants and subsequent general anesthetics should be abandoned to prevent emergency airway. item For those who can be effectively ventilated with the help of a mask but have difficulty in glottis exposure or intubation, they should be treated according to the anticipated difficult airway management process. In principle, the intubation time should not exceed 1 minute, or $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ should not be less than $92 %$. If intubation is unsuccessful, ventilation should be performed again until optimal oxygenation is achieved, and then the intubation method or personnel should be adjusted and intubation should be attempted again. item If difficulty in ventilation with a mask occurs after induction of general anesthesia, help should be sought immediately; at the same time, efforts should be made to resolve the ventilation problem in the shortest possible time, such as positive pressure ventilation with a mask (using an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway), laryngeal mask ventilation, etc. If ventilation can be improved, consideration may be given to waking the patient. item If ventilation difficulty is still difficult to correct, emergency airway management measures should be considered immediately, such as combined esophageal-tracheal tube, laryngeal mask ventilation, fiberoptic bronchoscope-assisted endotracheal intubation, retrograde guided endotracheal intubation, cricothyroidotomy with high-frequency jet ventilation, and cricothyroidotomy tube placement. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item In order to protect the patient's life safety, it is possible to consider terminating anesthesia in time and canceling the operation. end{enumerate} {Chapter 7 Perioperative Controlled Hypotension} During anesthesia and surgery, the patient's blood pressure is consciously lowered, and the degree and duration of blood pressure reduction can be actively adjusted, which is called controlled hypotension. Controlled hypotension can improve surgical conditions, facilitate surgical operations, reduce or control bleeding to reduce or avoid transfusion of allogeneic blood. {I. Physiological Basis of Controlled Hypotension} The function of blood circulation is to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues, and to transport $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and metabolites produced by tissues. Therefore, sufficient blood perfusion of tissues and organs is more important than simply high or low blood pressure. The blood flow $(Q)$ of normal human tissues is proportional to the pressure difference $( Delta P)$ at both ends of the blood vessels supplying the tissues, and inversely proportional to the blood flow resistance $(R)$. The relationship is: $Q= Delta P / R$. The pressure difference between the two ends of the blood vessel is positively correlated with the arterial pressure; when the blood viscosity remains unchanged, the blood flow resistance (i.e., vascular resistance) is negatively correlated with the caliber of the blood vessel. During controlled hypotension, the circulating blood volume and blood viscosity remain unchanged. Although the arterial pressure is reduced, the vascular resistance is reduced due to the expansion of peripheral blood vessels, which can maintain the blood perfusion of the tissues unchanged. This is essentially different from the hypotension during shock. During shock, the cardiac output decreases, the peripheral vascular resistance increases, the blood flow of tissue perfusion decreases and is insufficient, and local metabolic products accumulate. {II. The effect of controlled hypotension on the body} The effect of controlled hypotension on the blood supply of various organs is very complex. The degree of influence is related to the management experience, the drugs used, the degree of hypotension, the duration, and the physiological state of the organ itself. Cerebral ischemia and myocardial ischemia are the main dangers of controlled hypotension (Table 7-1). Table 7-1 The minimum limit of the organ's ability to self-regulate blood flow begin{center} begin{tabular}{cc} hline Organ & Minimum limit of perfusion pressure of self-regulatory ability hline Muscle & $20 sim 30 mathrm{mmHg}$ Intestine & $30 sim 40 mathrm{mmHg}$ Brain & $50 sim 60 mathrm{mmHg}$ Kidney & $60 sim 70 mathrm{mmHg}$ Skin, connective tissue & $100 mathrm{mmHg}$ hline end{tabular} end{center} The cerebral blood vessels have an autoregulatory mechanism. When the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is within the range of $50 sim 150 mathrm{mmHg}$, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be maintained constant at $50 mathrm{ml} /(100 mathrm{~g} cdot mathrm{min})$. Once MAP drops to $50 Below $40 mathrm{mmHg}$, CBF decreases with the decrease in blood pressure. The autoregulatory mechanism of hypertensive patients is impaired, and the lower limit of blood pressure is significantly increased, up to $100 mathrm{mmHg}$; if treated systematically, the autoregulatory mechanism and the lower limit of blood pressure can still return to normal. The normal coronary circulation of the heart has a high degree of pressure-flow self-regulation ability, and coronary blood flow is regulated by myocardial metabolic activity. Myocardial ischemic events rarely occur in patients with normal coronary circulation when controlled hypotension is used, unless the diastolic blood pressure drops below $40 mathrm{mmHg}$. However, when there is ischemic heart disease, the diastolic function of the coronary artery is impaired and it is difficult to self-regulate. The perfusion volume of the coronary artery is more dependent on the change of perfusion pressure. Therefore, patients suspected of ischemic heart disease should not undergo controlled hypotension. Normal renal blood flow has a good self-regulatory ability. When MAP is within the range of $80 sim 180 mathrm{mmHg}$, renal blood flow remains constant. When MAP is above $75 mathrm{mmHg}$, the glomerular filtration rate can be maintained. Although anuria may occur below $75 mathrm{mmHg}$, the blood perfusion volume can still meet the metabolic needs of renal cells, and urine volume can be quickly restored after stopping blood pressure reduction. The portal vein has no self-regulatory mechanism, and the pressure-blood flow self-regulatory function of the hepatic artery is limited. Systolic blood pressure below $60 mathrm{mmHg}$ may induce liver damage. However, patients with normal liver function rarely experience liver dysfunction when using controlled blood pressure reduction. The self-regulatory ability of gastrointestinal vascular is worse than that of the kidney and brain, and gastrointestinal hypoperfusion is prone to occur in severe hypotension. A decrease in MAP can cause a decrease in intraocular pressure, and occasionally induce visual impairment or even blindness. Therefore, a body position with eye pressure pressure should be avoided during controlled blood pressure reduction. During controlled blood pressure reduction, the blood flow to the skin and muscles is significantly reduced, and the oxygen partial pressure in the tissues decreases, but it will not cause ischemic necrosis of the skin and muscles. {III. Indications and contraindications for controlled hypotension} {(I) Indications} The purpose of controlled hypotension is to reduce blood loss and transfusion volume, improve surgical field conditions and increase the safety of surgical operations. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of controlled hypotensive technology and drugs, the shortage of blood sources and the awareness of complications of allogeneic blood transfusion, its indications have also been expanding. They include: begin{enumerate} item Surgery with expected heavy bleeding and difficult hemostasis, such as giant meningioma and pelvic surgery. item Vascular surgery, such as aortic artery stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and intraocular vascular malformations. item Microsurgery and delicate surgery with a small area and a clear surgical field, such as middle ear surgery and endoscopic sinus surgery. item Patients who have difficulty in massive blood transfusion or have contraindications to blood transfusion; or those who refuse blood transfusion due to religious beliefs. item Patients whose blood pressure, intraocular pressure and intraocular pressure increase excessively during anesthesia, which may lead to serious adverse consequences. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Contraindications} Anesthesiologists’ lack of knowledge and experience in controlled hypotension techniques can be considered an absolute contraindication. In addition, the following situations should be prohibited or used with caution: begin{enumerate} item Substantial lesions of important organs, such as cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, severe liver or kidney failure. item Vascular lesions, such as severe hypertension, arteriosclerosis, peripheral vascular claudication, and organ malperfusion. item Severe anemia or hypovolemia. item Patients with increased intracranial pressure should not undergo hypotension before craniotomy. item For patients with obvious reduction in oxygen transport to the body, organs, and tissues, the pros and cons of intraoperative controlled hypotension should be carefully weighed before use. end{enumerate} {IV. Implementation of controlled hypotension} Blood pressure is the main factor that determines the amount of bleeding from the surgical wound. Controlled hypotension must reach a certain low blood pressure level to achieve the purpose of reducing bleeding. Currently, controlled hypotension is mostly implemented by drug induction. Ideal antihypertensive drugs have the following characteristics: (1) convenient administration; (2) dose-dependent effect; (3) rapid effect, rapid recovery of blood pressure after drug withdrawal; (4) rapid elimination and non-toxic metabolites; (5) little effect on blood flow to important organs; (6) no increase in intracranial pressure and no effect on cerebral blood flow autoregulation during neurosurgery. Currently, antihypertensive drugs used in clinical practice have certain defects, but multiple drugs can be used in combination to achieve satisfactory results. {(I) Commonly used controlled antihypertensive drugs and methods} begin{enumerate} item Inhaled anesthetics for blood pressure reduction Isoflurane or sevoflurane are commonly used for blood pressure reduction, and enflurane and desflurane are also used. Inhaled anesthetics mainly reduce blood pressure by dilating peripheral blood vessels and inhibiting myocardial contractility. When reducing blood pressure, oxygen consumption is reduced, there is no damage to pulmonary gas exchange, and the operation is simple. However, its ability to dilate blood vessels is not strong, the degree of blood pressure reduction is limited, and it is often used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. If high concentrations of inhaled anesthetics are inhaled, the myocardial contractility will be inhibited, the cardiac output will be reduced, and organ perfusion will be insufficient. Item Intravenous anesthetics for lowering blood pressure Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol combined with remifentanil is often used to lower blood pressure. Propofol has the effects of dilating blood vessels, inhibiting the myocardium and reducing intracranial pressure. It can also be combined with vasoactive drugs such as sodium nitroprusside for controlled blood pressure reduction to achieve a more satisfactory effect. end{enumerate} {3. Vasodilator antihypertensive drugs} (1) Sodium nitroprusside: It mainly acts on small arteries, directly acts on vascular smooth muscle to relax it, reduces peripheral vascular resistance, and rarely affects myocardial contractility. The drug acts quickly, has reliable effects, and is easy to adjust. A solution containing sodium nitroprusside at $100 sim 200 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{ml}$ is usually prepared and intravenously dripped at a rate of $0.5 sim 8 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min}$ or injected via injection. Blood pressure begins to drop around 1 minute, and can be reduced to the predetermined value in 4 to 6 minutes. Blood pressure begins to rise within a few seconds after drug withdrawal, and can return to the pre-hypertensive level after 2 to 5 minutes. There are no serious side effects of short-term use of sodium nitroprusside. However, large doses or long-term infusion (more than 24 hours) can cause the accumulation of metabolites, nitrogen compounds, and result in cellular hypoxia. The prepared sodium nitroprusside solution and infusion line should be protected from light, and if not used up within 3 hours, it should be discarded and re-prepared. (2) Nitroglycerin: It mainly acts on capacitance vessels, directly inhibits vascular smooth muscle to dilate veins, reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart, and leads to a decrease in cardiac output and lower blood pressure. When nitroglycerin is used to lower blood pressure, there is no change in capillary perfusion, and the oxygen partial pressure of myocardial and liver tissues remains normal, but its antihypertensive effect is not as good as sodium nitroprusside. A solution containing nitroglycerin $100 sim 200 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{ml}$ is often prepared for intravenous infusion, starting from $10 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{min}$, and the speed is adjusted according to the antihypertensive response. The blood pressure drops relatively slowly, often taking $2 sim 5$ minutes, and the blood pressure can return to normal after $5 sim 10$ minutes of stopping the drug. (3) Adrenergic receptor antagonists: Phentolamine is an $ alpha $ adrenergic receptor antagonist with a strong direct vasodilation effect. It takes effect quickly after intravenous injection, reaches a peak effect within 2 minutes, and lasts for about 5 minutes. It is mainly used to control perioperative hypertension, especially for controlling blood pressure during surgical exploration and tumor separation of pheochromocytoma. Urapidil can block peripheral $ alpha $ receptors and stimulate 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors in the brain, producing a vasodilation effect, and has no sympathetic activity, nor does it affect intracerebral pressure, intracerebral compliance, and cerebral blood flow. Esmolol is a short-acting selective $ beta_{1}$ receptor antagonist with an extremely fast onset of action and can be used alone to lower blood pressure. Since esmolol lowers blood pressure by reducing cardiac output, it should be limited to patients who need mild blood pressure reduction or those who take other antihypertensive drugs in combination. (4) Antagonists: They have the effect of dilating peripheral blood vessels, coronary arteries and cerebral blood vessels, and can reduce blood pressure without causing tachycardia. For controlled hypotension, nicardipine is used for drip infusion at a dose of $100 sim 250 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$, which is mostly used for patients who need short-term hypotension. {(II) Safety limits of controlled hypotension} The ideal level of controlled hypotension depends on the patient's age, physical condition, body position and surgical needs. It is generally believed that systolic blood pressure or MAP is allowed to drop to $2/3$ of the basal blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure of young people can be reduced to $60 sim 70 mathrm{mmHg}$, while that of the elderly should be reduced to $80 mathrm{mmHg}$ or above. MAP should not be lower than $50 mathrm{mmHg}$, and when it must be reduced to $50 mathrm{mmHg}$, the duration should not exceed 30 minutes. For patients with a long operation time, if the standard is to reduce the basic blood pressure by $30%$, the maximum time of each blood pressure reduction should not exceed 1.5 hours. From a clinical perspective, according to the physiological characteristics that the blood supply of the skin and connective tissue decreases earlier than the blood supply of important organs, the amount of bleeding from the surgical wound should be closely monitored during the implementation of controlled blood pressure reduction. If the amount of bleeding and oozing is significantly reduced and there is no active oozing in the surgical field, this is the optimal low blood pressure level for the patient. If there is no oozing in the surgical field or the oozing is dark red, it indicates that the blood pressure is too low. During the process of blood pressure reduction, as long as ischemic changes are found in the electrocardiogram, blood pressure reduction should be abandoned to ensure safety. {(III) Monitoring and management of controlled blood pressure reduction} begin{enumerate} item Monitoring Blood pressure, $ mathrm{ECG}, mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and urine volume should be routinely monitored during blood pressure reduction. Arterial blood pressure is best measured by direct arterial pressure measurement, which can timely and accurately measure changes in arterial pressure. Electrocardiogram can monitor the occurrence of myocardial ischemia. Urine output is an important monitoring indicator and should be maintained above $1 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$. For patients with long surgery time, $ mathrm{CVP}, mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}, mathrm{Hct}$, body temperature, arterial blood gas analysis and blood electrolytes should be monitored. Monitoring CVP is used to assess cardiac preload and blood volume; monitoring $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ helps to avoid hyperventilation. end{enumerate} {2. Management during hypotensive period} (1) Controlled hypotension is generally performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation to facilitate respiratory management. During hypotension, both pulmonary shunt and dead space volume may increase, so adequate oxygen supply is necessary to avoid hypoventilation or hyperventilation. $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ that is too high or too low can cause cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. (2) The blood pressure should be lowered and raised slowly. Regardless of the measures used to implement controlled hypotension, blood pressure should be gradually lowered or raised when hypotension is started or stopped, so that the body, especially the cerebral blood vessels, can adapt. (3) Use body position to adjust blood pressure. Since antihypertensive drugs inhibit vasoconstriction and contraction, blood distribution can be affected by gravity and change with changes in body position. Placing the surgical field at the highest point can reduce bleeding. (4) When the hypotensive effect is not obvious, the hypotensive measures should be changed in time, or other hypotensive drugs should be used in combination. (5) Blood volume should be replenished in time. Insufficient effective circulating blood volume can cause a sharp drop in blood pressure or insufficient perfusion of important organs. In addition, appropriate infusion can slightly reduce blood viscosity and prevent thrombosis caused by slow blood flow. (6) Try to reduce the amplitude and time of hypotensive reduction. After the main surgical steps are completed, stop the hypotensive measures immediately. (7) Pay attention to eye protection when lying prone to avoid long-term local pressure that may cause postoperative visual impairment. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Management after stopping antihypertensive drugs Stopping antihypertensive drugs does not mean that the effects of antihypertensive drugs have completely disappeared. Patients should still be monitored for respiratory and circulatory systems, maintain good oxygen supply and replenish blood volume, reduce changes in patient position, and closely observe urine output. end{enumerate} {V. Complications and prevention of controlled antihypertensive drugs} Controlled antihypertensive drugs have certain potential risks and should be treated with caution. Common complications include: (1) cerebral embolism and cerebral hypoxia; (2) coronary artery insufficiency, myocardial infarction, heart failure and even cardiac arrest; (3) acute kidney injury; (4) vascular embolism; (5) rebound bleeding after antihypertensive drugs; (6) persistent hypotension and shock; (7) drowsiness, delayed awakening or mental disorders after awakening; (8) respiratory dysfunction; (9) blindness. The occurrence of complications may be related to the choice of antihypertensive indications, or the mastery and management of antihypertensive techniques. Factors that may lead to complications include: low blood pressure and prolonged duration; insufficient blood transfusion and fluid infusion during hypotension; insufficient blood volume; poor respiratory and body position management; lack of proper understanding of the patient's potential risk factors before surgery, etc. {Chapter 8 Perioperative Temperature Management} Body temperature is one of the main vital signs of the human body. The relative stability of body temperature is crucial to maintaining various physiological functions of the human body. The normal body temperature of an adult is about $37^{circ} mathrm{C}$. The body temperature regulation system usually maintains the core temperature within $0.2^{circ} mathrm{C}$ of the normal value. Large deviations will cause metabolic disorders in the body and even lead to the death of the patient. There are many factors that affect body temperature during anesthesia, and abnormal body temperature has a great impact on the human body. Therefore, we should be highly aware of the factors that affect body temperature during anesthesia and their hazards, and correctly prevent and deal with abnormal changes in body temperature.\n",

Physiological Regulation of Body Temperature} begin{enumerate} item Body Temperature Regulation Center Body temperature regulation refers to the temperature receptors receiving stimulation from the internal and external environmental temperatures. Through the activity of the body temperature regulation center, the activities of tissues and organs such as endocrine glands, skeletal muscles, skin blood vessels and sweat glands are changed accordingly, thereby adjusting the body's heat production and heat dissipation process to keep the body temperature at a relatively constant level. The body temperature regulation of the human body is mainly composed of three parts: peripheral and central temperature receptors, hypothalamic body temperature regulation center and peripheral and central body temperature regulation effectors. The basic center of body temperature regulation is in the hypothalamus. There is a heat dissipation center in the anterior part of the hypothalamus, and a heat production center in the posterior part of the hypothalamus. There is a mutual inhibition relationship between the two centers. After the afferent impulses of the temperature receptors are integrated by the hypothalamus, the center sends impulses (or causes the pituitary gland to release hormones), which changes the activities of effectors such as endocrine glands, internal organs, skeletal muscles, skin blood vessels and sweat glands, adjusts the body's heat production and heat dissipation process, and thus can maintain a relatively stable body temperature. item Body temperature regulation The body temperature regulation of the human body is an automatic control system. The ultimate goal of control is deep body temperature, represented by heart and lung temperature. There are two types of body temperature regulation, namely behavioral body temperature regulation and autonomic body temperature regulation. Behavioral body temperature regulation refers to the process by which the human body regulates its body temperature through its behavior so that it does not become too high or too low. For example, people marching in place or running in the cold to keep warm are both such regulation. Autonomic body temperature regulation refers to the process by which the human body regulates its physiological activities of heat production and heat dissipation under the control of the body temperature regulation center, such as shivering, sweating, vasoconstriction, etc., to maintain a relatively constant body temperature. end{enumerate} (1) Heat production: refers to the process by which the body dissipates the rest of its energy in the form of heat energy outside the body, except for $20% sim 25%$ used for work during metabolism. The organs that produce the most heat are internal organs (especially the liver) and skeletal muscles. The heat produced by internal organs accounts for about $52%$ of the total heat produced by the body; the heat produced by skeletal muscles accounts for about $25%$. During exercise, muscle heat production increases dramatically, reaching more than $90%$ of the total heat. Cold environmental stimulation can cause skeletal muscle to shiver, increasing heat production by 4 to 5 times. The heat production process is mainly controlled by factors such as the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system and thyroid hormones. Because heat energy comes from chemical reactions of material metabolism, the heat production process is also called chemical body temperature regulation. (2) Heat dissipation: refers to the heat dissipation of the skin through physical methods such as radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation, also known as physical body temperature regulation. The speed of heat dissipation mainly depends on the temperature difference between the skin and the environment. The higher the skin temperature or the lower the ambient temperature, the faster the heat dissipation. When the ambient temperature is close to or equal to the skin temperature, the above three heat dissipation methods are ineffective. Skin temperature is determined by the blood flow and blood temperature of the skin. When the sympathetic nerves are excited, the skin blood vessels contract, the blood flow decreases, and the skin temperature decreases. On the contrary, the skin temperature rises. Therefore, the dilation and contraction of skin blood vessels is an important form of temperature regulation. Evaporation is a very effective way to dissipate heat. Each gram of water can absorb $0.58 mathrm{kcal}(1 mathrm{kcal}=4.2 mathrm{~kJ})$ of vaporization heat when it evaporates. At room temperature, the water that evaporates through the surface of the body is called insensible evaporation, which is about $1000 mathrm{ml}$ per day. Among them, about $600 sim 800 mathrm{ml}$ evaporates through the skin, and about $200 sim 400 mathrm{ml}$ evaporates through the lungs and respiratory tract. Generally, when the ambient temperature rises to $25 sim 30^{circ} mathrm{C}$, the sweat glands begin to secrete sweat, which is called sweating or sensible evaporation. When the ambient temperature is equal to or higher than body temperature, the evaporation of sweat and water becomes the only way to dissipate heat. {II. Factors affecting body temperature during anesthesia and surgery} During anesthesia and surgery, patients are susceptible to changes in body temperature due to a variety of factors. Passive hypothermia is a common phenomenon, and occasionally hyperthermia may occur. begin{enumerate} item Effects of general anesthesia on thermoregulation Under general anesthesia, due to the loss of consciousness of the patient and the use of muscle relaxants, the body's behavioral thermoregulation is weakened or even disappears, and autonomic thermoregulation can also be inhibited by general anesthetics. Its characteristics are that the threshold range of thermoregulation reaction increases and the intensity of thermoregulation reaction decreases. end{enumerate} (1) Reasons for the decrease in body temperature during general anesthesia: the body's metabolic rate decreases, heat production decreases; central inhibition, hypothalamic thermoregulation set point moves downward, and sensitivity to changes in body temperature decreases; vasodilation, increased heat dissipation, etc. (2) Causes of elevated body temperature during general anesthesia: Unsmooth induction and too shallow anesthesia can increase skeletal muscle tension and heat production; $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation caused by anesthesia machine failure can lead to elevated body temperature; malignant hyperthermia can occur in very rare patients. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Effects of spinal anesthesia on temperature regulation Because the afferent and efferent impulses of nerves are blocked, temperature perception is interfered with, and normal temperature regulation reactions are inhibited, such as lowering the threshold of vasoconstriction and shivering. Sympathetic nerve blockade causes vasodilation and increased heat dissipation. Toxic reactions of local anesthetics can cause increased muscle tension, convulsions, etc., which can increase body temperature. item Effects of other drugs (1) Adrenergic receptor agonists, such as epinephrine, can cause skin vasoconstriction, increase muscle tone, and increase body temperature; (2) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, amphetamines, and tricyclic antidepressants can all lead to a high metabolic state; (3) Anticholinergics, such as atropine, can inhibit sweat gland secretion and affect heat dissipation. item Effect of ambient temperature If the room temperature is too low, the patient's body temperature is likely to drop after anesthesia; if the room temperature is too high, the area covered by the surgical sterile sheet, and the humidity increase, the body's heat dissipation can be restricted, causing the body temperature to rise. item Effect of age Children have a large body surface area and their body temperature regulation center is not fully developed, especially newborns and premature infants, who are prone to abnormal body temperature. The elderly have a lower metabolic rate and poor self-temperature regulation ability, and are prone to hypothermia during the perioperative period. Item Impact of surgical procedures (1) Surgery near the hypothalamus can affect the hypothalamic temperature set point, leading to a rise in central body temperature; (2) Thoracic and abdominal surgeries, with large exposed areas and long duration, can cause a significant drop in body temperature; (3) Flushing the body cavity with large amounts of cryogenic fluid or performing local hypothermia to protect organs during surgery can cause systemic cooling. item Other influencing factors (1) During inflammation, infection and sepsis, the body releases inflammatory mediators. Dehydration, metabolites, transfusion and infusion reactions, etc. can all increase body temperature. (2) For patients with weak constitution, large amounts of low-temperature fluids or stored blood during surgery, alcohol skin disinfection, etc. can lower body temperature. end{enumerate} {III. Impact of abnormal perioperative body temperature on patients} Constant body temperature is the basic guarantee for maintaining various physiological functions of the body. Severe abnormal body temperature can cause a series of metabolic disorders in the body. It is generally believed that when the patient's body temperature is lower than $36^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, it is hypothermia. begin{enumerate} item Impact of hypothermia Hypothermia is a common complication during anesthesia and surgery. Among patients undergoing surgical operations, $50 % sim 70 %$ experience hypothermia; about $1 / 2$ patients have a body temperature below $36^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, and about $1 / 3$ have a body temperature below $36^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. The patient's body temperature is lower than $35^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. Hypothermia can lead to many complications and should be taken seriously. end{enumerate} (1) Circulatory system: The incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia in patients with intraoperative hypothermia is three times that of patients with normal intraoperative temperature. Hypothermia directly inhibits sinoatrial node function and slows conduction. Heart rate and cardiac output decrease as body temperature decreases. It increases the sensitivity of myocardial cells to calcium ions and is prone to ventricular fibrillation. Severe hypothermia can lead to increased peripheral vascular resistance, ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial depression. (2) Energy metabolism: In the absence of a cold response, the human body's metabolic rate decreases as body temperature decreases, but the oxygen consumption of each organ is not consistent. Brain oxygen consumption changes less when it is above $31^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. Hypothermia can cause a significant decrease in organ blood flow and an increase in anaerobic metabolic products. Shivering caused by hypothermia can increase heat production by $100% sim 300%$, oxygen consumption and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production also increases. (3) Blood system: Hypothermia can inhibit platelet function and reduce various coagulation factors and fibrinogen, causing coagulation disorder, increased oozing and bleeding. In addition, hypothermia increases capillary hydrostatic pressure, intravascular fluid transfers to tissue spaces, blood volume decreases, blood concentrates, and blood viscosity increases, increasing the possibility of thrombosis. (4) Nervous system: Hypothermia can reduce the oxygen consumption of the central nervous system, which is beneficial to reducing intracranial pressure and brain protection within a certain range; cerebral blood flow decreases and cerebral vascular resistance increases; slows down the conduction velocity of peripheral nerves, but the action potential is enhanced, so muscle tension increases. (5) Respiratory system: The respiratory rhythm slows down and deepens as the body temperature drops. When the body temperature is lower than $25^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, breathing becomes weaker or even stops; reduces the ventilation response of the respiratory center to hypoxia and high carbon dioxide; dilates the bronchi, Increase dead space; oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left, which is not conducive to tissue oxygen supply, etc. (6) Liver and kidney function: Hypothermia can reduce liver metabolism and detoxification capacity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, and inhibit renal tubular reabsorption and secretion function. At the same time, hypothermia can also increase the liver's tolerance to hypoxia and protect renal ischemia. (7) Incision infection rate: Even a slight decrease in body temperature can directly damage the body's immune function, especially inhibiting the oxidative killing effect of neutrophils, increasing the incision infection rate. (8) Effect on anesthesia: Hypothermia can increase the sensitivity of the central nervous system to anesthetics, especially inhaled anesthetics. For example, for every $1^{circ} mathrm{C}$ decrease in body temperature, the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of halothane and isoflurane decreases by about $5%$; the duration of action of intravenous anesthetics, muscle relaxants and opioid analgesics is significantly prolonged, significantly prolonging the recovery time from anesthesia; the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine is increased. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Effects of hyperthermia end{enumerate} (1) Increased metabolic rate and increased oxygen consumption. (2) Increased heart rate and increased cardiac workload, making arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia more likely to occur. (3) Increased minute ventilation and respiratory alkalosis. (4) Sweating and vasodilation can lead to decreased blood volume and reduced venous return. (5) Severe water and electrolyte disturbances and acid-base imbalance. (6) When body temperature rises above $40^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, it often causes convulsions. {IV. Perioperative temperature protection} {1. Prevention and treatment of hypothermia} (1) Maintaining or increasing the ambient temperature can reduce radiative heat dissipation. If the room temperature is below $21^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, anesthetized patients are likely to suffer from hypothermia. (2) Use heating blankets and electric blankets to keep warm, but the temperature should be below $40^{circ} mathrm{C}$ to avoid injury. (3) Warm the infused fluids and blood, especially for patients who need to infuse large amounts of fluid. When flushing body cavities (thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, bladder, etc.) with large amounts of fluid, heated fluids should be used to avoid heat loss. (4) Covering exposed body surfaces can reduce conduction and convection heat dissipation. A layer of covering can reduce heat loss by about $30%$. However, warming measures should not be taken on ischemic tissues, such as when the aorta is clamped. (5) Use a closed or low-flow semi-closed anesthesia circuit to reduce evaporative heat dissipation and reduce heat loss. Use a heated humidifier in the anesthesia circuit to reduce evaporative heat dissipation in the lungs. (6) Use radiant heaters and heating lamps to keep warm. However, the heating lamp should be at least $70 mathrm{~cm}$ away from the patient to avoid injury. {2. Prevention and treatment of hyperthermia} (1) Avoid and eliminate factors that cause hyperthermia, and continuously monitor body temperature. (2) Use ice, cooling blankets, or lower the ambient temperature to lower the temperature of exposed skin, or use cold saline intracavitary lavage, such as abdominal or chest lavage. (3) Apply volatile liquids (such as alcohol) to the skin to accelerate evaporative heat dissipation. (4) Use drugs such as sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin to dilate blood vessels to increase conductive heat dissipation. (5) Administer centrally acting drugs such as aspirin and acetaminophen through a gastric tube or rectum. (6) Malignant hyperthermia refers to a hypermetabolic crisis caused by certain anesthetics that induces systemic muscle rigidity and causes a sharp rise in body temperature and progressive circulatory failure. It can be treated with the specific drug dantrolene. {V. Hypothermia} Hypothermia anesthesia is also called systemic hypothermia, which is to artificially lower the patient's body temperature by physical methods on the basis of general anesthesia, aiming to lower the temperature and metabolic rate of the whole body and various tissues and organs, especially the brain tissue, reduce oxygen consumption, increase the tolerance of cells to hypoxia, and thus protect the brain and other organs with high metabolic rates. Hypothermia is divided into mild hypothermia $ left(32 sim 35^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$, moderate hypothermia (28～ $ left.32^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$ and deep hypothermia (below $28^{ circ} mathrm{C}$) according to its degree.\n",
      "{(I) Cooling methods} begin{enumerate} item Surface cooling is often used to implement mild hypothermia and moderate hypothermia. The most commonly used methods include: ice water bath or ice chips cooling, ice bag, ice cap cooling and variable temperature blanket cooling. Ice water bath or ice chips cooling is often used in some major vascular surgery or neurosurgery. Ice bag and ice cap cooling is often used to cool children. In the case of brain resuscitation and intraoperative high fever, the head can be cooled with ice bags. Variable temperature blanket cooling is mainly suitable for mild hypothermia or maintenance of hypothermia. item Body cavity cooling is mainly used as an auxiliary means and remedy for hypothermia in body cavity surgery, and is rarely used alone. item Extracorporeal blood cooling During extracorporeal circulation, an artificial heart-lung machine and a thermostat are used to cool the blood flow to reduce the body temperature to the expected value. This method is rapid and safe, and is often used in moderate hypothermia and deep hypothermia, or used in combination with surface cooling. item Intravenous infusion of cold liquid $ left(4 sim 6^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$ Cooling is generally used in special circumstances. Due to the limitation of the infusion volume, the degree of cooling is limited. In addition, be alert to arrhythmias caused by too fast infusion of cold liquid. end{enumerate} {(II) Rewarming} After the surgical steps are basically completed, rewarming can be started. Common rewarming methods include: surface rewarming, chest or abdominal rewarming with $40 sim 45^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ saline, and blood rewarming under extracorporeal circulation. Rewarming can be stopped when the body temperature rises to $32^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ or above. Rewarming is generally not necessary for those whose body temperature has reached $32^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. {(III) Precautions for hypothermic anesthesia} begin{enumerate} item Anesthesia treatment General anesthesia must be used as a guide before cooling. At the beginning of cooling, anesthesia must be deep and muscle relaxation must be sufficient to achieve the purpose of inhibiting stress response and cold resistance response. Under hypothermia, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate depth of anesthesia, provide sufficient oxygen, improve microcirculation, and maintain acid-base balance to reduce the damage caused by hypothermia. item Body temperature monitoring Core temperature can be measured at the pulmonary artery, tympanic membrane, distal esophagus or nasopharynx, but it can also be roughly estimated clinically by the temperature of the mouth, axilla or rectum. The temperature of each part can indirectly represent the temperature of a certain organ, such as the temperature of the distal esophagus can represent the heart temperature; the rectum represents the internal body temperature; the nasopharynx or tympanic membrane temperature represents the brain temperature. item Cooling speed and range There are many factors that affect the drop in body temperature, mainly: ① Cooling method, extracorporeal circulation is the fastest; (2) Age, body surface area and obesity, children are faster, obese patients are slower; (3) Anesthesia depth, when anesthesia is too shallow, the cold response cannot be completely suppressed, affecting cooling; (4) Room temperature and season. The cooling range is determined by the surgical site and the ischemic safety time limit of the blocked blood circulation organ at different temperatures. end{enumerate} {(IV) Indications for hypothermic anesthesia} begin{enumerate} item Cardiovascular surgery Hypothermia combined with extracorporeal circulation is now widely used in complex open heart surgery and major vascular surgery that requires blood circulation blocking. item Neurosurgery Giant internal carotid aneurysm, carotid cavernous sinus and cerebral hemangioma surgery, etc. item Toxic disease or hypermetabolic state In cases of thyroid storm, viral encephalitis and malignant hyperthermia, hypothermia should be applied to reduce metabolism and oxygen consumption. item Brain resuscitation Brain resuscitation after cardiac arrest, choosing the method of cooling the head as the focus, can prolong the interruption of cerebral circulation and improve the prognosis. item Liver and kidney surgery Hypothermia can increase the tolerance of the liver and kidney to ischemia and hypoxia, and prolong the blockage time. end{enumerate} {(V) Complications of hypothermic anesthesia} begin{enumerate} item Cold reaction During the cooling process, patients may have a cold reaction, which is manifested as chills, vasoconstriction, skin pallor, increased muscle tension, etc. Anesthesia should be deepened appropriately, and muscle relaxants or ganglion blocking drugs should be used. item Arrhythmia Various arrhythmias may occur during the cooling process, the most serious of which is ventricular fibrillation. When the body temperature is above $30^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, ventricular fibrillation rarely occurs, while when the body temperature is below $28^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation increases significantly. Therefore, we should strengthen the monitoring of body temperature, maintain stable circulation, prevent hypoxia and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation, and avoid acid-base imbalance and electrolyte disturbance. item Tissue damage When the body surface is cooled, the auricle and fingers/toes come into contact with ice chips or ice packs come into direct contact with the skin, which can cause frostbite. During the rewarming process, excessive temperature can cause ulcers. item Acidosis Insufficient tissue perfusion at low temperature can cause metabolic acidosis. During general anesthesia, blood acid-base changes should be closely monitored for early detection and timely treatment. item Gastrointestinal bleeding Stress ulcers or intestinal artery embolism cause visceral bleeding. end{enumerate} {Chapter 9 $ quad$ Postanesthesia Recovery Room} {Section 1 Overview} The postanesthesia care unit (PACU) is also called the postanesthesia monitoring and treatment room or the anesthesia recovery room. The main task of PACU is to provide close monitoring and treatment for patients after anesthesia on the same day, before they fully wake up and are transferred to the general ward, so as to ensure that the patients safely pass through the anesthesia recovery period; if the patient is in a critical condition and needs further monitoring and treatment, he/she will be transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). PACU is under the leadership of the director of the anesthesia department and is jointly managed by the physician in charge and the head nurse. The recovery room is generally open during the day, and patients undergoing emergency surgery at night can be directly sent to the ICU. If the unit has a large number of surgeries and emergency surgeries, it can also be open 24 hours a day. The recovery room is responsible for daily work by full-time physicians and nurses, and the number of nurses can be based on a ratio of $2 sim 3: 1$ to beds. PACU should be spacious and bright, and easy for beds to enter and exit; equipped with emergency medicines and equipment, including: multi-function monitors, ventilators, defibrillators, infusion springs, and airway management equipment; equipped with central oxygen supply, compressed air and central suction devices; multi-function power sockets, etc. {Section 2 Work Routine and Leaving Room Standards} {I. Work Routine} PACU receives patients who have not awakened after general anesthesia and whose condition has not stabilized after surgery. Patients are transferred from the operating room to the PACU under the supervision of anesthesiologists. After the patient enters the PACU, the patient should be immediately placed, necessary monitoring should be established and vital signs should be recorded; the airway should be kept open, oxygen should be inhaled, and fluids should be infused; for patients who have not recovered their respiratory function and have endotracheal intubation, a ventilator should be used to assist or control their breathing. Anesthesiologists should provide PACU physicians and nurses with relevant information about the patient, including: (1) the patient's general information, current medical history, past medical history, and treatment status; (2) surgical method, time, and anesthesia method; (3) anesthesia induction and maintenance medication and other drug use, the amount of narcotic analgesics and muscle relaxants used, the time of last use, and the use of antagonists and other drugs; (4) intraoperative vital signs; (5) intraoperative blood loss, infusion, blood transfusion, and urine output; (6) intraoperative changes in the patient's condition, such as difficult airway, ECG changes, hemodynamic abnormalities, abnormal bleeding, etc.; (7) current problems, treatment measures, and possible complications; (8) provide a complete record sheet to the PACU, and the patient may leave only after the PACU medical staff takes over. Routine monitoring includes: respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and body temperature; patients with endotracheal intubation should be connected to a ventilator for mechanical ventilation and monitor relevant respiratory parameters; patients with radial artery and central venous catheters should monitor direct arterial pressure and CVP. PACU management includes: (1) Monitoring and recording $ mathrm{BP}, mathrm{HR}, mathrm{RR}$ and $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ every 5-10 minutes to determine the degree and speed of recovery. Those who recover slowly should be treated, such as residual muscle relaxants or antagonism of narcotic analgesics. (2) Observe the state of consciousness, pupil changes, facial and lip color, and maintain airway patency. (3) All tubes should be properly fixed and drainage should be unobstructed. (4) Keep the wound material intact and observe the patient's wound condition. (5) Restrain the patient. {II. Standards for leaving the room} begin{enumerate} item Mental status The patient is conscious and can move according to instructions; the orientation ability is restored, and the patient can recognize time and place. item Respiratory aspects Spontaneous breathing is restored and the airway can be kept open; cough and swallowing reflexes are restored, and the patient has the ability to clear foreign objects from the mouth; there is no difficulty in breathing, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ is above $95%$ when breathing air, and the skin and mucous membranes are ruddy in color. If the patient's condition is serious and respiratory support is required, the patient should be transferred to the ICU. item Circulatory system Hemodynamics are stable, and the heart rate and blood pressure do not exceed $ pm 20%$ of the preoperative value and remain stable for more than 30 minutes; no vasoactive drugs or antiarrhythmic drugs are used; the heart rhythm is normal, and there is no obvious acute ischemic change in ECG. If vasoactive drugs are still needed to support circulatory function, the patient should be transferred to the ICU. item Patients who have used narcotic analgesics and sedatives due to pain or agitation should be observed for 30 minutes without abnormal reactions. item For patients who have received local anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, motor function and proprioception have recovered, circulation and respiration are stable, and vasoactive drugs are not needed. item Evaluation of awakening degree Refer to: Steward awakening score (Table 9-1), patients with a score of 4 or above can leave the recovery room; or Alderete score standard (Table 9-2), when the highest score is 10, it means that the patient has recovered well after surgery, and generally patients with a score of 9 can be transferred to the general ward. end{enumerate} Table 9-1 Steward Awakening Score begin{center} begin{tabular}{clll} hline Score & multicolumn{1}{c}{Awakeness} & multicolumn{1}{c}{Airway patency} & multicolumn{1}{c}{Limb mobility} hline 2 & Fully awake & Can cough as directed & Can move limbs consciously 1 & Responds to stimulation & Can maintain airway patency without support & No conscious limb movement 0 & No response to stimulation & Airway requires support & No limb movement hline end{tabular} end{center} Table 9-2 Alderete Scoring Criteria begin{center} begin{tabular}{ccl} hline Item & Score & multicolumn{1}{c}{Standard} hline Activity & 0 & No movement & 1 & Both limbs can move Breathing & 2 & All limbs can move & 0 & Breathing, airway obstruction Circulation & 1 & Shallow breathing, but adequate ventilation & 2 & Deep breathing, coughing, satisfactory saturation & 0 & Blood pressure changes more than $50%$, ECG changes significantly Awake & 1 & Blood pressure changes within $20% sim 50%$ of preoperative level, slight ECG changes & 2 & Blood pressure changes within $20%$ of preoperative level, no ECG changes & 0 & No response Skin color & 1 & Able to be awakened & 2 & Fully awake & 0 & Cyanosis & 1 & Pale hline end{tabular} end{center} Note: Since the Alderete scoring system cannot accurately reflect whether the patient has anuria, pain, severe nausea, vomiting or arrhythmia, it has certain limitations {Section 3 Common complications of PACU} The anesthesia recovery period is the period from the discontinuation of anesthetics to the time when the patient's vital signs stabilize or become awake. It is also a special period with risk factors. Complications that endanger life safety may occur at any time and require close monitoring and timely treatment. PACU is an important place to continue to observe the condition after the operation, prevent late complications of anesthesia, ensure patient safety, and improve medical quality. The incidence of PACU complications varies depending on the patient composition, and PACU complications are more common in patients with mild to moderate diseases. Studies have shown that the general complication rate of PACU is about $5%$.\n",
      "{I. Respiratory complications} begin{enumerate} item Airway obstruction Airway obstruction is prone to occur during the recovery period from anesthesia, especially after the patient's endotracheal tube is removed. For details on the causes, clinical manifestations and treatment of airway obstruction, please refer to \"Chapter 6 Airway Management\" in this book. item Hypoventilation Low minute ventilation can lead to increased $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and acute respiratory acidosis. The clinical manifestations of postoperative hypoventilation are hypercapnia and hypoxemia; insufficient tidal volume, or slow respiratory rate; arterial blood gas analysis: $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>45 mathrm{mmHg}$, and $ mathrm{pH}<7.30$. Common causes and treatments: (1) Central respiratory depression: including damage from brain surgery, residual effects of anesthetics, narcotic analgesics and sedatives. Mechanical ventilation should be used to maintain breathing until respiratory function is fully restored. If necessary, reverse it with antagonists. (2) Residual effects of muscle relaxants: Hepatic and renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance and the use of antibiotics can slow down the metabolism of muscle relaxants and aggravate the residual effects of muscle relaxants after surgery. Respiration should be assisted or controlled until the respiratory muscle strength is fully restored. Antagonists should be given if necessary. (3) Postoperative low lung volume syndrome: Factors such as chest and abdominal surgery, pain stimulation, abdominal distension, tight chest and abdominal belts and excessive obesity can limit lung expansion and lead to insufficient ventilation, especially in patients with COPD. Postoperative analgesia should be strengthened, and patients should be encouraged and helped to take deep breaths and cough. Preventive mechanical ventilation should be performed if necessary. (4) Pneumothorax: It is a complication of surgery and some invasive procedures. Auscultation or chest X-ray can confirm the diagnosis. Closed chest drainage should be performed immediately. (5) Bronchial spasm: It is prone to occur in patients with COPD, asthma or recent respiratory tract infection. Aminophylline, corticosteroids or epinephrine can be injected intravenously. item Hypoxemia General anesthesia can inhibit hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory drive and reduce functional residual capacity (FRC). These changes can last for a period of time after surgery and easily lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. Clinical manifestations: $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}<90 %, mathrm{PaO}_{2}<60 mathrm{mmHg}$ when breathing air; tachypnea, cyanosis, altered mental state, restlessness, dullness; tachycardia, arrhythmia, and increased blood pressure. Common causes and treatments: (1) Upper airway obstruction, hypoventilation or pneumothorax; (2) Diffuse hypoxia: more common in $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ anesthesia, after stopping $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O}$ inhalation, pure oxygen $5 sim 10$ minutes should be inhaled; (3) Atelectasis: encourage patients to take deep breaths, cough and perform chest physical therapy; (4) Pulmonary aspiration: mild cases are effective with oxygen therapy, severe cases should be treated with mechanical ventilation; (5) Pulmonary infarction: mainly supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation; (6) Pulmonary edema: may occur in acute left heart failure or increased pulmonary capillary permeability. Treatment includes cardiotonic, diuretic, vasodilation, oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP. end{enumerate} {II. Circulatory system complications} begin{enumerate} item Postoperative hypotension Clinical manifestations include a systolic blood pressure drop of more than $30%$ compared to preoperative blood pressure; oliguria or metabolic acidosis; signs of organ insufficiency, such as myocardial ischemia and central nervous system dysfunction. The cause of the occurrence is related to decreased preload, suppressed myocardial function and decreased peripheral resistance. For patients with hypotension caused by hypovolemia, the possibility of occult bleeding after surgery should be excluded. Suppressed myocardial function can reduce cardiac output and cause hypotension. There are many reasons for the decrease in cardiac inotropic effect, such as pre-existing congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia. Under any negative inotropic effect, a decrease in preload will increase the severity of hypotension. During the anesthesia recovery period, the peripheral vascular resistance decreases due to the effect of general anesthesia, and the significant decrease in cardiac afterload can also cause hypotension. Treatment should be targeted at the cause. item Postoperative hypertension is a common complication during the anesthesia recovery period. Clinical manifestations include a systolic blood pressure increase of more than $30%$ compared to preoperative levels; for patients with a history of hypertension, systolic blood pressure is higher than $180 mathrm{mmHg}$ or (and) diastolic blood pressure is higher than $110 mathrm{mmHg}$. Common causes of postoperative hypertension include pain, restlessness, hypoxemia and (or) hypercapnia, increased intracranial pressure, urinary retention, and discontinuation of antihypertensive drugs before surgery in hypertensive patients. Treatment should be targeted at the cause, such as analgesia, correction of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and reduction of blood pressure. In general, moderately elevated blood pressure can be left untreated; however, for patients with coronary heart disease, aortic or cerebral aneurysm, and those undergoing recalcitrant surgery, blood pressure should be controlled with drugs. Item Arrhythmia Common causes of arrhythmia include: sympathetic nerve excitement, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, electrolyte and acid-base imbalance, myocardial ischemia, and increased intracranial pressure. Atrial premature beats and occasional ventricular premature beats generally do not require treatment. Sinus tachycardia is often secondary to pain, restlessness, fever or hypovolemia. If it is not accompanied by hypotension or myocardial ischemia, only the cause needs to be treated. Sinus bradycardia can be caused by narcotic analgesics, $ beta$ receptor blockers or vagal nerve excitement, and is generally effective in response to atropine. Rapid supraventricular arrhythmias include: paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, junctional tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and flutter, which can lead to myocardial ischemia if not treated in time. Symptomatic treatment should be based on the cause, and short-acting $ beta$ receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis drugs can be considered for treatment. Generally, ventricular premature beats and stable non-sustained ventricular tachycardia do not require immediate treatment. Reversible causes (hypoxia, myocardial ischemia, acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and stimulation of the central venous catheter) should be sought. If ventricular premature beats are multi-source, frequent, or accompanied by R on T phenomenon, it indicates myocardial insufficiency and should be treated actively. end{enumerate} {Three, postoperative nausea and vomiting} Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication after general anesthesia. Its causes {Chapter 9 Post-anesthesia recovery room} may be related to patient factors, anesthetic drugs, type of surgery, postoperative analgesia, etc. High-risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting include: female, history of motion sickness, use of nitrous oxide, non-smoking, upper abdominal surgery, etc. Clinical observations have found that the incidence of PONV can be reduced by standardizing preoperative medication, rationally using antiemetics, optimizing general anesthesia medication and PACU management. {IV. Agitation and shivering} The causes of postoperative agitation include: residual effects of anesthetics; postoperative wound pain; stimulation of indwelling urinary catheters; fear of unfamiliar environments in the early stage of awakening, especially in pediatric patients. Symptomatic treatment should be given according to the cause, and appropriate sedatives and analgesics can be given if necessary. Shivering in PACU patients may be related to shallow anesthesia, low body temperature (low room temperature in winter and summer, exposed incisions, infusions, etc.), postoperative pain, infusion reactions, and fear during awakening. Heat preservation measures should be strengthened for PACU patients, and appropriate sedatives and analgesics can be given if necessary. {V. Neurological complications} begin{enumerate} item Failure to regain consciousness If the patient's consciousness does not recover 90 minutes after the end of general anesthesia, it is called delayed awakening after general anesthesia. There are many reasons for delayed awakening, including age, type of surgery, surgery time, drug effects, general condition of the patient and surgical conditions. The elderly, infants, malnourished and hypothermic patients have a reduced demand for anesthetics. They should pay attention to the dosage of anesthesia, observe patiently after the operation, and do not use awakening drugs. They should be patient and wait for them to smoothly pass the anesthesia recovery period. In addition, the reasons for delayed awakening also include the residual effects of anesthetics. For example, the use of opioids during surgery can easily cause delayed awakening after surgery. At present, ultra-short-acting inhaled anesthetics (such as sevoflurane), intravenous general anesthetics (such as propofol) and opioids (such as remifentanil) are used in combination, and delayed awakening due to excessive anesthesia is rarely caused. In addition, patients with liver and kidney dysfunction, hypoproteinemia, etc. are prone to delayed awakening from anesthesia due to reduced metabolic function, and the dosage of anesthesia should be reduced as appropriate. Long-term low cerebral perfusion during surgery can not only cause delayed awakening, but also cerebral infarction, especially in patients with hypertension. Other metabolic factors, such as hypoglycemia, hyperosmolar and hyperglycemic coma without ketosis, hyponatremia, etc., can also lead to delayed awakening after surgery. Blood sugar and electrolyte monitoring should be strengthened and corresponding treatment should be made. item Intraoperative awareness The incidence of intraoperative awareness is $0.1% sim 0.4%$, which may have a certain impact on the patient's emotional and mental health. However, there is currently no reliable method to prevent its occurrence $100%$. It is usually the result of light anesthesia techniques, especially in trauma, cardiac and obstetric anesthesia. Risk factors include: young patients, history of drug abuse, ASA grade III $ sim mathrm{V}$ and the use of muscle relaxants. end{enumerate} {VI. Hypothermia} Hypothermia can delay the awakening of patients under general anesthesia. For those who are prone to intraoperative hypothermia, such as the elderly, patients with long surgical time, and patients undergoing thoracotomy and laparotomy, body temperature should be monitored and warming measures should be strengthened, such as using warm blankets, increasing the ambient temperature, and warming the infusion and blood transfusion. {VII. Renal complications} begin{enumerate} item Oliguria Urine volume less than $0.5 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$ is considered oliguria. Common causes: hypovolemia, hypotension, low cardiac output. Postrenal causes include catheter obstruction or detachment, bladder rupture or renal vein compression. First, check whether the catheter is unobstructed and whether the bladder is full. Do not blindly use diuretics to avoid aggravating oliguria caused by hypovolemia. Oliguria after surgery can be corrected after appropriate volume replenishment and blood pressure recovery. If necessary, furosemide can be injected intravenously, or dopamine can be continuously injected, or mannitol can be dripped intravenously. item Polyuria Urine volume is disproportionately greater than the amount of fluid infused. Common causes: excessive infusion, drug-induced diuresis, hyperglycemia, osmotic diuresis caused by hypertonic saline and mannitol, diabetes insipidus, etc. Symptomatic treatment should be given. item Disorders of electrolytes Due to polyuria or oliguria and patients with endocrine diseases, electrolyte disorders of varying degrees may occur during the perioperative period, such as hypokalemia/hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and other complications, which may induce arrhythmia in severe cases. They should be corrected in time to avoid serious arrhythmia and even death. end{enumerate} {Chapter 10 Intensive Care Unit} {I. Overview} The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a professional discipline that integrates relevant professional knowledge and technology, advanced monitoring and treatment equipment, and professionals conduct close monitoring and active treatment of the physiological functions of critically ill patients. The development of ICU is closely related to the specialty of anesthesiology. During anesthesia, anesthesiologists use various monitoring techniques most frequently, especially monitoring of exhalation, circulation and central nervous system functions; they are most familiar with airway control and respiratory management, including observation of respiratory patterns, establishment of artificial airways, artificial/mechanical ventilation, etc.; they often perform large-scale and rapid infusion and blood transfusion during surgery, use a variety of vasoactive drugs and other potent and fast-acting drugs; and they are most familiar with knowledge and techniques of cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation. The application of these monitoring techniques can timely detect potential high-risk factors that endanger life, so that preventive and therapeutic measures can be taken in time; they can accurately judge the condition and carry out effective treatment. The specialization of ICU is a development trend. The management of ICU by the Department of Anesthesiology is an important part of the construction of anesthesia disciplines. Due to the uneven development of various regions, the Department of Anesthesiology can manage ICUs with undergraduate characteristics according to the development direction and expertise of this specialty, such as surgical ICUs (SICUs) that mainly treat postoperative critically ill patients, ICUs that mainly treat trauma and shock patients, and respiratory ICUs (RICUs) that mainly treat patients with respiratory dysfunction. ICU is equipped with advanced equipment, which can carry out comprehensive, continuous and quantitative monitoring; it has early diagnosis and advanced treatment methods; it adopts modern management, has high work efficiency and successful rescue rate; and has a well-trained medical nursing team. ICU works under the leadership of the director of anesthesiology, and its daily work is in the charge of ICU physician. Patients admitted to ICU are mainly managed and treated by ICU attending physicians, but the original condition of the patient should still be handled by the original chief physician. Because the condition of ICU patients is complicated, it often requires multi-professional joint discussion and treatment. Therefore, ICU physicians must maintain close cooperation with experts in cardiology, pharmacology, imaging medicine, nutrition, etc. to improve clinical efficacy. The number of beds in each ICU management unit is preferably $8 sim 12$. The ratio of the total number of ICU nurses to the number of beds is $3: 1 sim 4: 1$. There are $1 sim 2$ head nurses, who are responsible for nursing and nurse training, and participate in administrative management; and equipped with professional therapists (such as respiratory therapists) and engineering and technical personnel.\n",
      "{II. Main tasks and responsibilities of ICU} begin{enumerate} item Main tasks Closely observe and monitor critically ill patients, promptly detect and deal with high-risk factors, analyze and evaluate the condition, promptly diagnose and actively prevent and treat primary diseases and symptoms. Especially after the end of anesthesia and surgery, the effects of anesthetics have not completely disappeared, various reflexes have not fully recovered, anesthesia and surgery interfere with the patient's physiological functions, or the patient's coexisting diseases and other factors, which require more careful monitoring, treatment and care by medical staff to prevent various accidents and complications and ensure that patients safely pass the perioperative period. Patients admitted to the ICU are under the care of the anesthesiologist and the original ward physician. item Responsibilities of ICU medical care Patients are mainly monitored and treated by ICU physicians and nurses. ICU nurses should insist on bedside monitoring, and physicians should emphasize direct vision diagnosis and treatment. Specific requirements are as follows: end{enumerate} (1) Establish appropriate monitoring methods and other auxiliary examinations according to the condition, such as chest X-rays, blood biochemistry, etc. (2) Maintaining the stability of body fluids and internal environment: including water, electrolyte, acid-base and osmotic pressure balance. (3) Respiratory management and treatment: respiratory management, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation therapy, etc. (4) Circulatory management and supportive treatment: such as the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and vasoactive drugs. (5) Management of important organ functions and treatment of disorders. (6) If a specialist condition is found, timely communication should be made with the original ward physician for timely diagnosis and treatment. (7) The ICU attending physician should make rounds at least twice a day, and the department director should make rounds $1 sim 2$ times a week. Difficult problems should be reported to the department director in a timely manner or organized for consultation. {Chapter 10 Intensive Care Monitoring and Treatment Ward} (8) Undertake consultation tasks within and outside the hospital within the scope of the specialty, mainly including: (1) cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation; (2) treatment of severe shock; (3) respiratory therapy; (4) multiple organ dysfunction; (5) implementation of bedside monitoring technology, etc. {3. Duties of the attending physician of the original ward} (1) Specialized treatment of the primary disease, including surgery, postoperative recovery process and diagnosis and treatment of complications. (2) Provide opinions on the treatment of patients and participate in the discussion and decision-making of special treatment plans, such as infusion, blood transfusion, application of antibiotics and other special drugs, tracheotomy, mechanical ventilation, etc. (3) Make daily rounds and propose consultation with relevant specialists, special examinations or tests according to the patient's condition. (4) When necessary, explain the patient's condition to the patient's family together with the ICU physician. (5) Work closely with the ICU physician and respect each other; when there is a disagreement, each physician should consult with the superior physician or department director to resolve it. {III. ICU admission and transfer criteria} {(I) Admission} The ICU mainly admits various types of critically ill patients who are likely to recover after close monitoring and active treatment. Through monitoring, treatment and nursing in the ICU, the admitted patients can obtain therapeutic effects that cannot be achieved in ordinary wards. Patients with advanced tumors and other diseases that are prone to cross infection or infectious diseases should not be admitted to ordinary ICUs. ICUs should admit corresponding patients according to their own professional characteristics. Generally speaking, ICUs managed by the Department of Anesthesiology mainly admit postoperative patients. Including: begin{enumerate} item Patients who need to continue to use mechanical ventilation after anesthesia surgery and patients who have serious complications during anesthesia surgery, such as cardiac arrest, shock, and massive bleeding. item Patients who need close monitoring and treatment and are in danger of life, such as cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. item Patients with serious pathological and physiological conditions before surgery who need to continue to strengthen monitoring and treatment after surgery, such as the elderly, various heart diseases, hypertension, diabetes, major organ dysfunction and other serious diseases. item Patients after major or newly launched large-scale surgery. end{enumerate} {(II) Standards for transfer out of ICU} ICU is a place for implementing intensive monitoring and treatment. When the function of the patient's important organs is stable, they should be transferred to the general ward. The reference standards are as follows: begin{enumerate} item The patient is conscious and can recognize time, place and people, etc.; he can move consciously or according to instructions. item The patient's spontaneous breathing is stable, he can take deep breaths and cough effectively, and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ are within the normal range. item The circulatory function is stable, as shown by stable blood pressure and heart rate, no vasoactive drugs, good peripheral circulation, and no serious arrhythmia. item No serious surgical complications, no serious water, electrolyte and acid-base imbalance. item No signs of acute failure of liver and kidney function. end{enumerate} {IV. ICU monitoring items} A large amount of work in the ICU is to observe and monitor critically ill patients so that the condition can be judged in time and appropriate treatment and treatment measures can be taken. Although there are many advanced monitoring methods, clinical examinations and monitoring data still need to be analyzed and judged by doctors. Monitoring is not the purpose, but to provide a basis for treatment. The principle of selecting monitoring must be that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and non-invasive monitoring methods should be selected as much as possible. {(I) Circulatory system monitoring} begin{enumerate} item Electrocardiogram The clinical significance of monitoring electrocardiogram is mainly to understand the speed of heart rate, to make an accurate diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia, and it is also of great value in judging the condition of myocardial ischemia. item Arterial blood pressure Blood pressure is the basic parameter for measuring the state of circulatory function. Factors that determine the level of blood pressure include: cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, blood volume, vascular elasticity and blood viscosity. However, the perfusion of tissues and organs depends on two factors: blood pressure and vascular resistance. When peripheral blood vessels are over-contracted and resistance increases, although blood pressure can be maintained normal, tissue perfusion is reduced. Therefore, blood pressure is not the only indicator for measuring circulatory status. For patients with unstable circulation, direct arterial pressure measurement is often used. It can continuously monitor the dynamic changes of blood pressure, analyze myocardial contractility based on arterial waveforms, and repeatedly collect arterial blood gas samples. item Central venous pressure (CVP) refers to the pressure of the superior and inferior vena cava or the average right atrium located in the chest, which mainly reflects the balance between right heart function and venous return. Monitoring CVP is of great clinical significance for evaluating the relationship between right heart function and its preload. item Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), also known as Swan-Ganz catheter, can obtain a series of hemodynamic data, including CVP, right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), measure cardiac output (CO), calculate cardiac index $(CI)$, stroke volume $(SV)$ and stroke index $(SI)$, etc., for complicated cases or extremely unstable circulatory function. It is a better hemodynamic monitoring method at present. item Other monitoring Such as observing the color of skin and mucous membranes, capillary refill time, urine volume, body temperature, etc. end{enumerate} {(II) Respiratory function monitoring} Indicators that can be measured at the bedside are most suitable for monitoring critically ill patients. The current status of the patient's lung function and the estimation of whether he can tolerate a certain treatment are based on the collection of the original medical history, physical examination of the respiratory system, chest X-ray and blood gas analysis, etc. Table 10-1 shows the commonly used respiratory function monitoring parameters. Table 10-1 Common respiratory function monitoring parameters begin{center} begin{tabular}{lc||lc} hline multicolumn{1}{c|}{parameter} & normal value & multicolumn{1}{c}{parameter} & normal value hline Tidal volume $ left( mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}, mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg} right)$ & $5 sim 7$ & Oxygen partial pressure $ left( mathrm{PaO}_{2}, mathrm{mmHg} right)$ & $80 sim 100$ Respiratory rate $( mathrm{RR}$, times/min) & $12 sim 20$ & Pulse oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SpO}_{2}, % right)$ & $96 sim 100$ Minute ventilation $( mathrm{MV}, mathrm{L} / mathrm{min})$ & $6 sim 8$ & Intrapulmonary shunt $ left( mathrm{Qs}_{ mathrm{s}} / mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{T}}, % right)$ & $3 sim 5$ Dead space volume $/$ Tidal volume $ left( mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}} right)$ & $0.25 sim 0.40$ & Vital activity $( mathrm{VC}, mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg})$ & $65 sim 75$ Partial pressure of carbon dioxide $ left( mathrm{PaCO}_{2}, mathrm{mmHg} right)$ & $35 sim 45$ & Maximum inspiratory force $ left( mathrm{MIF}, mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} right)$ & $75 sim 100$ hline end{tabular} end{center} {(III) Neurological monitoring} Clinical observation is the most commonly used method to observe and record the patient's consciousness, reflexes, pupil changes, etc. The Glasgow coma scale can be used to assess the degree of consciousness disorder (Table 10-2): the highest score of 15 indicates a state of unconsciousness; 8 points or less indicates a coma; the lowest score of 3 indicates a state of near death. If necessary, cerebral blood flow, electroencephalogram or evoked potential, intraocular pressure, etc. can be monitored after brain injury or surgery. Table 10-2 Glasgow Coma Scale begin{center} begin{tabular}{cc||cc||lc} hline Eye opening response & Score & Verbal response & Score & Motor response & Score hline Automatic eye opening & 4 & Correct answer & 5 & Comply with missed activity & 6 Eye opening on call & 3 & Incorrect answer & 4 & Localization of tingling pain & 5 Eye opening on verbalization & 2 & Incoherent speech & 3 & Avoiding tingling pain & 4 No response & 1 & Can only make sounds & 2 & Limb flexion & 3 & & Cannot make sounds & 1 & Limb hyperextension & 2 hline end{tabular} end{center} {IV. Renal function monitoring} Continuous monitoring of the dynamic changes in renal function can not only evaluate the functional status of the kidneys themselves, but also has important value in assessing the systemic tissue perfusion, fluid balance and cardiovascular function. Timely detection of early signs of renal insufficiency can lead to effective treatment and prevention measures to avoid acute renal failure. (V) Other monitoring Record 24-hour blood pressure, serum sodium, sodium, chloride, etc.; Check hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count and classification, platelet count, check coagulation factors and fibrinolytic activity in case of coagulation disorder; Liver function often monitors blood bilirubin, albumin, globulin and enzyme changes; Observe abdominal pain, bowel sound changes, pay attention to intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, etc.; Monitor endocrine function, blood sugar, nutritional status, etc. as needed. {V. ICU treatment} {(I) Respiratory therapy} begin{enumerate} item Oxygen therapy is to make the patient's inhaled oxygen concentration $ left( mathrm{FiO}_{2} right)$ higher than the atmospheric oxygen concentration through different oxygen supply devices to achieve the purpose of correcting hypoxemia and improving oxygen supply. Such as nasal cannula oxygen inhalation and mask oxygen inhalation. item Chest physiotherapy Chest physiotherapy is a general term for methods to maintain respiratory hygiene, promote secretion discharge, and prevent or reverse lung collapse, including postural drainage, back patting, chest vibration, assisted coughing, and respiratory function training. item Mechanical ventilation Mechanical ventilation is an effective method for treating respiratory failure. Pulmonary ventilation dysfunction caused by any reason is an indication for mechanical ventilation. Continuous positive airway pressure can also improve lung diffusion function, reduce pulmonary edema, and prevent atelectasis by increasing functional residual capacity. During mechanical ventilation, respiratory tract humidification and secretion clearance should be strengthened to prevent lung infection. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Circulatory treatment} It is very important to maintain the circulatory function of critically ill patients in the ICU, which depends on the correct evaluation and maintenance of heart rate, heart rhythm, cardiac preload, afterload and myocardial contractility. Maintaining normal circulating blood volume is the basis of circulatory stability; improving myocardial function is the driving force of circulatory stability. If necessary, vasoactive drugs can be used to increase cardiac output; appropriate afterload is a necessary condition for improving tissue perfusion. When treating arrhythmias, in addition to the rational selection of antiarrhythmic drugs, hypoxia, $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation, acid-base imbalance and electrolyte disturbance should be corrected at the same time. {(III) Correction of water and electrolyte balance disturbance} Critically ill patients in the ICU may suffer from dehydration or excessive water, low sodium or high sodium, low potassium or high potassium, calcium and magnesium imbalance, acidosis or alkalosis, etc. due to various reasons, which may aggravate circulatory, respiratory, liver and kidney dysfunction and need to be corrected in time. {(IV) Nutritional support} Due to various reasons, the energy demand of critically ill patients increases significantly, but they cannot take in nutrition normally, which is very unfavorable for the recovery of the disease. Reasonable nutritional support can accelerate the recovery of the disease, reduce complications and reduce the mortality rate. Generally, intravenous supplementation of glucose, amino acids, etc. can be used. Deep vein nutritional support is required for severe or long-term patients, preferably enteral nutritional support. {(V) Other treatments} Prevention and control of infection, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to maintain internal environment stability and appropriate sedation and analgesia are very important for critically ill patients. {Chapter 11 Respiratory function monitoring and clinical application} In addition to observing clinical manifestations, respiratory function monitoring can also use instruments to measure respiratory function data and draw graphs for analysis. The items, scope and methods of respiratory function monitoring are constantly increasing and improving. At present, electronic and automated comprehensive monitors are mostly used for continuous monitoring. {Section 1 General monitoring of respiratory function} begin{enumerate} item Monitoring of respiratory movements Including respiratory rate, amplitude, pattern, etc. During normal breathing, the chest is symmetrical on both sides, and the chest and abdomen are synchronized; the respiratory rate is $10 sim 16$ times/min. More than 20 times/min indicates potential respiratory disorders, and more than 30 times/min often manifests as obvious shortness of breath. Too slow a respiratory rate can be seen in severe hypoxia, central nervous system diseases or opioid overdose. Upper airway obstruction may present with a three-recess sign, and contraction of the neck respiratory accessory muscles can be seen. Lower airway obstruction is manifested by tense abdominal muscles and prolonged exhalation during exhalation. item Auscultation and percussion of the chest Auscultation and percussion are basic methods for understanding lung lesions. Pathological respiratory sounds such as dry and wet rales and wheezing all indicate lesions in the corresponding lungs; and asymmetric respiratory sounds, in addition to indicating atelectasis, inflammation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion on one side, indicate that the catheter is too deep and enters one main bronchus (usually the right side) in patients with endotracheal intubation. Chest auscultation is helpful in the diagnosis of pneumothorax, pleural effusion and pleural lesions. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Monitoring of Ventilatory Function} {(I) Commonly used ventilation monitoring} begin{enumerate} item Tidal volume (tidal volume, $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$ ) refers to the amount of gas inhaled or exhaled each time during quiet breathing. The tidal volume during normal spontaneous breathing is $5 sim 7 mathrm{~mL} / mathrm{kg}$ . When $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$ is insufficient, in order to maintain $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ within the normal range, the respiratory rate must be increased to compensate. However, the faster the respiratory rate, the greater the dead space ventilation and the greater the work of breathing. When the respiratory rate exceeds 35 times/min, respiratory failure may occur due to a significant increase in the work of breathing. Therefore, observing changes in respiratory rate is the simplest and most practical method for monitoring respiratory function. item minute ventilation ($ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{E}}$ ) and alveolar ventilation ($ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{A}}$ ) $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{E}}$ refers to the total amount of gas inhaled or exhaled per minute at rest, which is equal to the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate. Normal value: about 6. $6 mathrm{~L}$ for adult males and about $5.0 mathrm{~L}$ for adult females. Due to the existence of dead space, $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{E}}$ cannot represent alveolar ventilation. $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{A}}$ refers to the volume of fresh air inhaled into the alveoli per minute, and the calculation formula is as follows: end{enumerate} [ V_{1}=( text { tidal volume }- text { dead space volume }) times text { respiratory rate } ] For adults, $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{E}}$ lower than $ mathrm{~L}$ indicates hypoventilation, or a decreased respiratory rate or insufficient tidal volume; more than $ mathrm{~L}$ indicates hyperventilation. $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{E}}$ or $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{A}}$ that is too small will lead to hypoxia and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation, while excessive $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ excretion may lead to respiratory alkalosis. During mechanical ventilation, due to the increase of mechanical dead space, $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{E}}$ can be about $20%$ higher than that during non-mechanical ventilation. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Dead space volume/tidal volume $ left(V_{D} / V_{T} right)$ Dead space volume refers to the gas in the tidal volume that does not participate in gas exchange. In clinical practice, $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$ is often used to indicate the size of the dead space volume. The normal value of $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$ is $0.2 sim 0.3. An increase in mathrm{~V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$ indicates an increase in dead space ventilation. During spontaneous breathing, if $V_{ mathrm{D}} / V_{ mathrm{T}}$ is greater than 0.6, the alveolar ventilation efficiency is very low, the work of breathing increases significantly, and respiratory failure may occur. During mechanical ventilation, the positive pressure in the airway expands the capacity of the respiratory conduction system, resulting in increased ineffective ventilation and an increase in $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$. When $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}$ reaches 0.5, it is still clinically acceptable, but when it is higher than 0.6, it is difficult to evacuate the ventilator. Calculation method: $ mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}}=$ $ left( mathrm{PaCO}_{2}- mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2} right) / mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ . end{enumerate} {Chapter 11 Respiratory Function Monitoring and Clinical Application} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) refers to the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled per minute when trying to take deep and fast breaths. Generally, the deepest and fastest exhaled or inhaled air volume in 15 seconds is measured and then converted into maximum ventilation per minute. Normal value: about 104L for adult males; about 82L for adult females. Generally, the percentage of the measured value to the expected value is used as the judgment indicator, and it is reduced if it is lower than $80%$. MVV reflects the individual's ventilatory reserve function. In clinical practice, the reserve capacity of ventilation function is often expressed as the percentage of ventilatory reserve: end{enumerate} {Ventilatory reserve percentage $=($maximum ventilation - minute ventilation) $/$maximum ventilation $ times 100 %$} A ventilatory reserve percentage higher than $93 %$ is normal, lower than $86 %$ indicates poor ventilatory reserve, and lower than $70 %$ indicates severe impairment of ventilation function, and thoracic surgery should be performed with caution. MVV is often used to evaluate lung function before thoracic surgery. MVV<50 % predicted value indicates that the patient cannot tolerate lung resection. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV) FVC refers to the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled as quickly as possible after maximum inspiration. FEV is the volume of air exhaled per unit time and the percentage of forced vital capacity calculated based on FVC. For example, the forced expiratory volume of 1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds is expressed as $ mathrm{FEV}_{1}, mathrm{FEV}_{2}, mathrm{FEV}_{3}$, and $ mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is the most meaningful. The percentages of $ mathrm{FEV}_{1}, mathrm{FEV}_{2}, and mathrm{FEV}_{3}$ are $ mathrm{FEV}_{1}, mathrm{FEV}_{2}, and mathrm{FEV}_{3}$ are $ mathrm{FEV}_{1}, mathrm{FEV}_{2}, and mathrm{FEV}_{3}$ are $ mathrm{FEV}_{1}, mathrm{FEV}_{2}, and mathrm{FEV}_{3}$ respectively. For normal people, $ mathrm{FEV} / mathrm{FVC}(%)$ is generally greater than $ mathrm{80%$, which is mainly used to determine whether larger airways are blocked. end{enumerate} In normal cases, FVC is exhaled within 3 seconds. If it is exhaled within 1 or 2 seconds, it indicates restrictive ventilation disorder. In case of obstructive ventilation disorder, exhalation is prolonged. $ mathrm{FEV}_{1} %<70 %$ indicates airflow obstruction, which is seen in obstructive lung diseases such as bronchial asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. $ mathrm{FEV}_{1} %$ greater than normal value indicates restrictive ventilation dysfunction, which is seen in pleural thickening and adhesion, chest deformity, etc. In COPD patients, FEV decreases more significantly than FVC, so FEV $ %$ also decreases; in patients with restrictive lung disease, both FEV and FVC decrease, but $ mathrm{FEV}, %$ can still be normal, or even exceed $ mathrm{FEV}, %$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{5} item Maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) Divide the interval between the start and end points of the forced expiratory mid-segment curve into four equal parts, and calculate the average flow of the middle two equal parts $(25 % sim 75 %)$. Normal value: about $3.36 mathrm{~L} / mathrm{s}$ for adult males, about $2.38 mathrm{~L} / mathrm{s}$ for adult females, or expressed as a percentage of the measured value to the predicted value, and those greater than $75 %$ are normal. MMEF is more sensitive than MVV or $ mathrm{FEV}$ and has a certain value in assessing obstructive ventilation disorders. It mainly depends on the independent force-dependent part of FVC, so it is more sensitive than $ mathrm{FEV}, %$ and MVV in identifying airway obstruction. end{enumerate} $V_{E}, $MVV, FVC are measured by spirometry, and FEV and MMEF must be calculated based on the forced vital capacity curve drawn by the spirometry. {(II) Carbon dioxide monitoring}\n",
      "{(I) Oxygen exchange function} begin{enumerate} item Inspired oxygen concentration (inspired oxygen fraction) refers to the oxygen concentration in the inhaled air. Modern ventilators and anesthesia machines are equipped with oxygen concentration monitors, but they should be calibrated before use. item Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (arterial partial pressure of oxygen) refers to the tension generated by oxygen physically dissolved in arterial plasma. It not only reflects the amount of oxygen dissolved in plasma, but also affects the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin. Therefore, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is an important factor in determining the amount of oxygen transport and is also the only indicator for judging hypoxemia. When a healthy person breathes air at sea level, the normal value of $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is $80 sim 100 mathrm{mmHg}$. $60 sim 79 mathrm{mmHg}$ is mild hypoxemia; $40 sim 59 mathrm{mmHg}$ is moderate hypoxemia; and less than $40 mathrm{mmHg}$ is severe hypoxemia. However, the normal value of $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ decreases with age. For people over 60 years old, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ decreases by $1 mathrm{mmHg}$ for every year of increase. According to the oxygen dissociation curve, when $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is $60 mathrm{mmHg}$, the blood oxygen saturation is $90 %$. If $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is less than $60 mathrm{mmHg}$, the blood oxygen saturation is significantly reduced. Therefore, it is believed that the lowest $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ that humans can tolerate is $ mathrm{mmHg}$. To measure $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, arterial blood needs to be taken for blood gas analysis. The item oxygenation index is the ratio of $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ to the concentration of inhaled oxygen, that is, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}( mathrm{mmHg}) / mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ $( %)$, which should be greater than $ mathrm{mmHg}$ in normal people. When the pulmonary diffusion function is normal, $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ increases and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ also increases accordingly. Otherwise, it indicates pulmonary diffusion dysfunction or varying degrees of intrapulmonary shunt. For example, if $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is $400 sim 500 mathrm{mmHg}$, it indicates that the lung oxygen exchange efficiency is normal; $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 300 mathrm{mmHg}$ indicates that the lung's oxygen diffusion function is impaired and the patient has acute lung injury ( $ left. mathrm{ALI} right); mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant$ $200 mathrm{mmHg}$ indicates the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). end{enumerate} Recently, the European conference revised the criteria for oxygenation index in diagnosing ARDS and divided the course of the disease into three categories, as follows: Mild ARDS $200< mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 300$ ( PEEP or $ mathrm{CPAP} geqslant 5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ ) Moderate ARDS $100< mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 200 left( mathrm{PEEP} geqslant 5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} right)$ Severe ARDS $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 100 left( mathrm{PEEP} geqslant 5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} right)$ begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Arterial oxygen content is the amount of oxygen actually carried in $100 mathrm{ml}$ blood, and the normal value is $19 mathrm{ml} / 100 mathrm{ml}$ . $ mathrm{CaO}_{2}$ is one of the main factors determining oxygen supply. item Oxygen extraction rate (oxygen extraction ration, $ mathrm{O}_{2} mathrm{ER}$ ) refers to the percentage of oxygen taken up from arterial blood by tissue cells in the capillaries, which can be calculated using the formula $ mathrm{O}_{2} mathrm{ER}= mathrm{VO}_{2} / mathrm{DO}_{2}$ (oxygen consumption/oxygen supply). The normal value is $22 % sim 32 %$ . Under normal circumstances, tissues can maintain $ mathrm{VO}_{2}$ in a stable state by changing the oxygen uptake rate. When the body's oxygen demand is higher than the oxygen consumption, it means that the oxygen supply is insufficient and anaerobic metabolism has occurred. Oxygen demand changes with the metabolic rate of various tissues in the body, and it is also different in normal physiological and pathological states. The body can adjust the respiratory system, circulatory system, and microcirculatory system to meet the body's metabolic needs. If the oxygen uptake rate is lower than 0.22, it indicates that there is an oxygen uptake disorder, which may be caused by excessive cardiac output, abnormal blood perfusion distribution, etc.; if the oxygen uptake rate is greater than 0.30, it indicates that the oxygen demand is increased and the oxygen delivered to the tissue cannot meet the needs of cellular metabolism. item Pulse oxygen saturation (pulse oxygen saturation, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$) $ quad mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ is the arterial oxygen saturation value measured percutaneously by a pulse oximeter, and is a commonly used indicator for evaluating oxygenation function in clinical practice. The pulse oximeter is designed based on the different absorption spectra of oxygenated hemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin, and eliminates the interference of veins and capillaries through arterial pulsation signals. Factors that affect the accuracy of $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ include: (1) when low temperature $ left(<35^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$, low blood pressure $(<50 mathrm{mmHg})$, or the use of vasoconstrictor drugs weakens the pulse pulsation, its accuracy may be affected; (2) when there are substances in the blood that are consistent with the light absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin, such as methylene blue, methemoglobin $( mathrm{MetHb})$, and carboxyhemoglobin $( mathrm{COHb})$, its accuracy may be affected; (3) different measurement sites, external light source interference, etc. also affect its results. Continuous monitoring of $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ can timely detect hypoxemia caused by various reasons. Normal $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}>94%$; if $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}<90%$, it often indicates hypoxemia. item Mixed venous oxygen saturation (Mixed venous saturation of oxygen, $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$) is an indicator that reflects the balance between oxygen supply and oxygen consumption determined by cardiac output, arterial oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin. A decrease in oxygen supply or an increase in oxygen consumption will lead to a decrease in $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$. If there is no accident during anesthesia surgery, the arterial oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SaO}_{2} right)$, hemoglobin content, and systemic oxygen consumption are relatively constant for a period of time. At this time, the change in $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ mainly reflects the change in cardiac output. When hypoxia occurs, the body's compensatory mechanism has two main aspects: the first is to increase cardiac output, and the second is to take in more oxygen from the capillaries. Under normal circumstances, $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ is $97%$, and the difference between arterial and venous oxygen saturation is $22%$, while cardiac function has great compensatory potential. Normal people can increase oxygen supply by increasing cardiac output during activities, and tissue oxygen uptake also increases. Therefore, during exercise, $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ can drop to $31%$, and the difference between arterial and venous oxygen saturation can increase from $22%$ to $66%$. end{enumerate} The main significance of continuous monitoring of $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is: (1) Continuously reflect changes in cardiac output; (2) Reflect the balance between systemic oxygen supply and oxygen consumption; (3) Determine the indication for blood transfusion: $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}<50%$. The normal value of $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is $75% (65% sim 85%), mathrm{SvO}_{2}>65%$ indicates adequate oxygen reserves, $ mathrm{SvO}_{2} 50% sim 60%$ indicates limited oxygen reserves, and $ mathrm{SvO}_{2} 35% sim 50%$ indicates insufficient oxygen reserves (Table 11-1).

Studies have shown that $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ have a good correlation, are more clinically operable, represent the same trend, and can reflect tissue perfusion and oxygenation status; monitoring $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ can judge and treat potential tissue hypoxia in the early stage of the disease, which is more beneficial to the prognosis. The normal value of $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $70% sim 80%$. item Alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen $ mathrm{P}_{( mathrm{A-a})} mathrm{O}_{2}$ refers to the difference in oxygen partial pressure between alveolar gas and arterial blood, and is an important parameter for measuring pulmonary diffusion function and intrapulmonary shunt. Healthy people\n",
      "The prognosis is more favorable. The normal value of $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $70 % sim 80 %$ . item Alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen $ mathrm{P}_{( mathrm{A-a})} mathrm{O}_{2}$ refers to the difference in oxygen partial pressure between alveolar gas and arterial blood, and is an important parameter for measuring pulmonary diffusion function and intrapulmonary shunt. When a healthy person breathes air, the normal value of $ mathrm{P}_{(A-2)} mathrm{O}_{2}$ is $5 sim 10 mathrm{mmHg}$, while when breathing pure oxygen it is $40 sim 50 mathrm{mmHg}$ . end{enumerate} Clinical monitoring of $ mathrm{P}_{(A-a)} mathrm{O}_{2}$ is very helpful in determining the cause of hypoxemia. (1) $ mathrm{P}_{(A-a)} mathrm{O}_{2}$ normal hypoxemia: Insufficient ventilation or too low $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ can cause $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{A}} mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ to decrease simultaneously, while $ mathrm{P}_{( mathrm{A}- mathrm{s})} mathrm{O}_{2}$ remains unchanged; if accompanied by an increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, it indicates that the hypoxemia is caused by insufficiency of ventilation; if $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ remains unchanged or decreases, it may be due to too low $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$; (2) Hypoxemia with increased $ mathrm{P}_{(A- mathrm{a})} mathrm{O}_{2}$: except for the $ mathrm{P}_{(A- mathrm{s})} mathrm{O}_{2}$ In addition to the influence of mathrm{FiO}_{2}$, age, respiratory quotient and cardiac output, ventilation/perfusion ratio imbalance, intrapulmonary shunt and gas diffusion disorder can increase $ mathrm{P}_{(A-2)} mathrm{O}_{2}$. Dynamic observation of $ mathrm{P}_{(A-a)} mathrm{O}_{2}$ changes can reflect the change of shunt and is an indicator for judging the severity and prognosis of the disease. 10. $ mathrm{P}_{50}$ When $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ is $50 %$, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is called $ mathrm{P}_{50}$, which is an indicator reflecting the affinity of hemoglobin $( mathrm{Hb})$ and $ mathrm{O}_{2}$, and the normal value is $26.5 mathrm{mmHg}$. The oxygen dissociation curve can be plotted with $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ as the horizontal axis and the corresponding $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ as the vertical axis (Figure 11-3). The rightward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve promotes the dissociation of oxygenated hemoglobin and releases oxygen into the tissues; if it shifts to the left, the affinity between $ mathrm{Hb}$ and $ mathrm{O}_{2}$ increases, making it difficult to dissociate, and reducing oxygen release. Factors that affect the rightward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve include a decrease in $ mathrm{pH}$, an increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, an increase in temperature, and an increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG); factors that cause the leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve include an increase in $ mathrm{pH}$, a decrease in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, a decrease in temperature, and a decrease in $2,3-$ DPG. When a large amount of stored blood is transfused, the 2,3-DPG content in red blood cells decreases and the oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left. {(II) Intrapulmonary shunt $ left(Q_{S} / Q_{T} right)$} $ mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{S}} / mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{r}}$ refers to the ratio of blood flow that enters the left heart without oxygenation to cardiac output per minute. Under normal physiological conditions, blood from the bronchi, pleura and cardiac venules directly enters the pulmonary veins without passing through the pulmonary capillary bed and gas exchange, which is called anatomic shunt, and generally does not exceed 3% to 5%. When combined with pulmonary hemangioma, arteriovenous leakage and right-to-left shunt due to congenital heart disease, the anatomic shunt can be increased. In some pathological conditions, such as atelectasis, COPD, pulmonary edema, etc., when blood flows through non-ventilated or poorly ventilated alveoli, the ventilation/perfusion ratio is imbalanced, the blood cannot be fully oxygenated, and the pathological shunt increases. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-121} end{center} Figure 11-3 Oxygen dissociation curve and factors affecting the left and right shifts of the dissociation curve When $ mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{S}} / mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{T}}$ is greater than $10 %$, it indicates pathological shunt. When $ mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{S}} / mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{T}}$ is greater than $30 %$, even if high-concentration oxygen is inhaled, it is difficult to improve hypoxemia, and respiratory support therapy is required. The calculation method of $Q_{S} / Q_{T}$: [ mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{S}} / mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{T}}= left( mathrm{CcO}_{2}- mathrm{CaO}_{2} right) / left( mathrm{CcO}_{2}- mathrm{CvO}_{2} right) ] Where: $ mathrm{CcO}_{2}$ is the blood oxygen content at the end of the alveolar capillaries; $ mathrm{CaO}_{2}$ is the arterial blood oxygen content; $ mathrm{CvO}_{2}$ is the mixed venous blood oxygen content. $ mathrm{CcO}_{2}$ can be calculated by the following formula: [ mathrm{CcO}_{2}=1.38 times mathrm{Hb} times mathrm{SaO}_{2}+0.0031 times mathrm{PaO}_{2} ] {（三）Oxygen supply and oxygen consumption} begin{enumerate} item Oxygen supply (oxygen delivery, $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$ ) is the amount of oxygen provided by the body to tissues through the circulatory system per unit time, that is, the rate at which arterial blood transports oxygen per unit time. Its value is the product of cardiac index and $ mathrm{CaO}_{2}$, that is: end{enumerate} [ begin{gathered} mathrm{DO}_{2}= mathrm{CI} times mathrm{CaO}_{2} mathrm{CaO}_{2}=1.38 times mathrm{Hb} times mathrm{SaO}_{2}+0.0031 times mathrm{PaO}_{2} end{gathered} ] Where 1.38 is the coefficient of maximum oxygen binding per gram of $ mathrm{Hb}$; 0.0031 is the physical solubility coefficient of oxygen in blood. It can be seen from the formula that the factors that determine the amount of oxygen supplied to tissues are: circulation factors, respiratory factors and blood factors. The normal value of $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$ is $520 sim$ $720 mathrm{ml} / left( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{m}^{2} right)$. In clinical practice, anesthetic drugs inhibit cardiac function and reduce cardiac output, and bleeding or hypoventilation reduce $ mathrm{Hb}$ or $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}$, which can all lead to a decrease in $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Oxygen consumption (oxygen consumption, $ mathrm{VO}_{2}$) Oxygen consumption refers to the total amount of oxygen consumed by whole body tissues per unit time, which depends on the body's functional metabolic state. The normal value is $110 sim 180 mathrm{ml} / left( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{m}^{2} right)$. Under normal physiological conditions, $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{VO}_{2}$ match each other to maintain the balance of tissue oxygen supply and demand. end{enumerate} Methods for measuring oxygen consumption: (1) Reverse Fick method: According to the Fick principle, the total amount of oxygen taken up or released by an organ is equal to the product of the blood flow reaching the organ and the difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood, which can be expressed by the following formula: $ mathrm{VO}_{2}= mathrm{CI} times left( mathrm{CaO}_{2}- mathrm{CvO}_{2} right)$ . (2) Direct method: The oxygen consumption is directly measured by measuring the difference between the oxygen content in the inhaled air and the oxygen content in the exhaled air per unit time, which can be expressed as: $ mathrm{VO}_{2}= left( mathrm{FiO}_{2} times mathrm{Vi} right)- left( mathrm{FeO}_{2} times mathrm{Ve} right)$, where $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is the oxygen concentration of the inhaled air, $ mathrm{FeO}_{2}$ is the oxygen concentration of the exhaled air, $ mathrm{Vi}$ is the volume of inhaled air per minute, and Ve is the volume of exhaled air per minute. The factors that affect the increase of oxygen consumption are: (1) temperature rise, for every $1^{circ} mathrm{C}$ increase in body temperature, oxygen consumption increases by $10% sim 15%$; (2) infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome; (3) burns, trauma or surgery; (4) sympathetic nerve excitement, pain, chills or pain attacks, such as chills can increase oxygen consumption by $100%$; (5) $beta_{2}$ receptor agonists, amphetamines and tricyclic antidepressants, etc.; (6) high metabolic state or intake of high-sugar diet, etc. The use of sedatives, analgesics or muscle relaxants can reduce the cell metabolic rate and reduce the body's oxygen consumption. {Section 4 Monitoring of small airway function} Small airways refer to the fine bronchi with an inner diameter of less than $2 mathrm{~mm}$. Small airway lesions are often asymptomatic in the early stages of clinical presentation, and chest X-ray examinations and routine pulmonary function tests are also basically normal. Small airway function tests are helpful for early detection and diagnosis of lesions.\n",
      "{(I) Monitoring indicators and methods} begin{enumerate} item Closing volume (closing volume, $ mathrm{CV}$) Closing volume refers to the amount of air that can continue to be exhaled when the small airways in the drooping part of the lung begin to close during an exhalation. Closing capacity (closing capacity, CC) refers to the amount of air retained in the lung when the small airways begin to close, that is, the sum of the closing volume and the residual volume. Nitrogen is commonly used as a tracer gas in clinical practice, and the measurement is based on the relationship between the exhaled volume and the instantaneous nitrogen concentration of the exhalation. The measurement results are expressed as CV/VC and CC/TLC. item Maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve The MEFV curve refers to a curve formed by recording the flow rate and volume changes using an X-Y recorder during the maximum force of exhalation (Figure 11-4). The maximum expiratory flow rate in the first half of the curve depends on the force exerted by the subject during exhalation, while the maximum expiratory flow rate in the second half has nothing to do with the force exerted by the subject during exhalation, and mainly depends on the elastic recoil of the alveoli and the physiological function of the peripheral airways. Therefore, the shape of the curve and several flow parameters measured from the curve can be used as the basis for early diagnosis of small airway obstruction. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-122} end{center} Figure 11-4 Maximum expiratory flow-volume curve begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Frequency dependence of dynamic lung compliance (FDC) During inspiration and exhalation, the speed of alveolar inflation and emptying depends on the time constant, which is the product of compliance and resistance. Under normal circumstances, the time constant of each lung unit should be the same, so dynamic lung compliance is not affected by respiratory frequency. During quiet breathing, dynamic lung compliance is close to or slightly less than static lung compliance. During rapid breathing, due to the short inhalation time, the diseased lung units cannot be filled in time. In small airway diseases, lung compliance is affected by respiratory rate. As respiratory rate increases, compliance decreases. The phenomenon that dynamic lung compliance decreases significantly with increasing respiratory rate is called FDC, which is the most sensitive indicator for detecting early small airway dysfunction. end{enumerate} {(II) Clinical application of small airway function monitoring} begin{enumerate} item Increased CV/VC can be caused by small airway obstruction or decreased lung elastic recoil. It is common in long-term heavy smokers, air pollution, long-term exposure to volatile chemicals, bronchiolar infection, early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung lesions caused by connective tissue disease or pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. item MEFV curve is mainly used to examine small airway obstruction disease. The main indicators are $50%$ maximum expiratory flow of vital capacity and $25%$ maximum expiratory flow of vital capacity. It is expressed as a percentage of the measured value to the normal predicted value. If the measured value $/$ predicted value $<80%$, it is abnormal, indicating small airway dysfunction. item The ratio of the dynamic lung compliance to the static lung compliance at the same tidal volume in normal people is maintained above 0.8. When the small airways are diseased, rapid breathing (frequency>60 times/min) causes the small airways to close, the alveolar inflation volume decreases, resulting in a decrease in dynamic lung compliance, and the ratio of dynamic lung compliance to static lung compliance is less than 0.8. end{enumerate} {Section 5 Respiratory Mechanics Monitoring} {(I) Monitoring Indicators and Methods}\n",
      "{1. Airway pressure (Figure 11-5)} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-123} end{center} Figure 11-5 Airway pressure waveform (1) Peak inspiratory pressure (peak pressure, $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{pk}}$ ): refers to the highest pressure reached in the airway during the respiratory cycle. In patients with normal chest and lung compliance, it should be lower than $ mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ . Peak inspiratory pressure is related to airway resistance and chest and lung compliance. Excessive peak pressure can damage alveoli and airways, leading to barotrauma such as pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema. Generally, the peak pressure is limited to less than $ mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$. (2) Plateau pressure (P) is the pressure in the airway from the end of inspiration to the beginning of exhalation. At this time, the pressure in the lungs is equal and there is no airflow. Therefore, when the tidal volume remains unchanged, P is only related to the chest and lung compliance and can be used to calculate static lung compliance. Under normal circumstances, P is about 9 sim 13 cmH2O, and the plateau pressure is maintained for about 10% of the entire respiratory cycle. The plateau pressure can truly reflect the maximum pressure in the alveoli. Too high a plateau pressure and too long an inhalation time can increase the load on the pulmonary circulation. (3) End-expiratory pressure is the average pressure in the lungs from the end of exhalation to the beginning of inspiration. It should be zero under spontaneous breathing. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) breathing modes are often used in mechanical ventilation therapy. At this time, the end expiratory pressure is increased according to the set value. Airway pressure monitoring is an essential monitoring content during general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation in the ICU. If the airway pressure exceeds the alarm limit, the ventilator can emit an audible and visual alarm to alert the physician. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Airway resistance (airway resistance, $ mathrm{R}_{ mathrm{aw}}$ ) $ mathrm{R}_{ mathrm{aw}}$ refers to the friction between gas molecules and between gas molecules and airway walls when gas flows through the respiratory tract. It can be expressed by the pressure difference required to maintain a certain amount of gas entering the alveoli per unit time. The subject's airway resistance is calculated by measuring the pressure or volume changes in the plethysmograph chamber, the subject's oral pressure (equal to the alveolar pressure when the airflow is temporarily blocked) and the respiratory flow meter. When the ventilator is equipped with a flow meter, the air flow rate can be measured directly and calculated according to the following formula: end{enumerate} [ mathrm{R}_{ mathrm{aw}}= left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{pk}}- mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{plat}} right) / text { air flow rate } ] $ mathrm{R}_{ mathrm{aw}}$ The normal value is $1 sim 3 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} /( mathrm{L} cdot mathrm{s})$. During mechanical ventilation under anesthesia, $ mathrm{R}_{ mathrm{aw}}$ can increase to $9 mathrm{cmH} mathrm{c}_{2} mathrm{O} /( mathrm{L} cdot mathrm{s})$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Lung compliance (lung compliance, $ mathrm{C}_{1}$. ) refers to the change in lung volume caused by a unit change in transpulmonary pressure, that is, $ mathrm{C}_{ mathrm{L}}=$change in lung volume $( Delta mathrm{V})$ / transpulmonary pressure $ left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{tp}} right)$. Transpulmonary pressure $=$ alveolar pressure $ left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{alv}} right)$-intrathoracic pressure $ left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{pl}} right)$. Lung compliance is further divided into static lung compliance (static compliance, Cst) and dynamic lung compliance (dynamic compliance, Cdyn). Cst refers to the compliance measured when the airflow is temporarily blocked during the respiratory cycle, which is equivalent to the elasticity of the lung tissue. The normal value is $50 sim 100 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}_{ text {。 }}$ . Cdyn refers to the compliance measured when the airflow is not blocked during the respiratory cycle. Due to the influence of airway resistance, it can only reflect the elasticity of the respiratory system. The normal value of Cdyn is $40 sim 80 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ . It can be monitored by a bedside respiratory function monitor or a ventilator. In patients using mechanical ventilation, compliance can be calculated by monitoring airway pressure and tidal volume according to the following formula: end{enumerate} [ begin{aligned} & text { Cst }= mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}} / left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{pk}}- mathrm{PEEP} right) & text { Cdyn }= mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}} / left( mathrm{P}_{ text {plat }}- mathrm{PEEP} right) end{aligned} ] begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Pressure-volume loop ($P-V$ loop) The P-V loop refers to the curve loop of the relationship between the tidal volume of one respiratory cycle and the corresponding airway pressure (or tracheal carina pressure, intrathoracic pressure, intraesophageal pressure) depicted by a spirometry when the subject is breathing quietly or receiving mechanical ventilation (Figure 11-6). Because it represents the pressure-volume relationship of the force generated by the movement of the respiratory muscles to overcome the elastic resistance of the lung (pulmonary compliance) and the inelastic resistance (airway resistance and tissue viscosity) to expand the alveoli, it is also called the lung compliance loop. The P-V loop reflects the work done by the respiratory muscles to overcome the resistance to maintain ventilation (work of breathing). The inspiratory branch of the P-V loop has low and high inflection points. The low inflection point is a turning point that appears at the low lung volume of the inspiratory branch of the P-V loop, indicating the corresponding pressure and volume when the alveoli begin to open. The high inflection point is a turning point that appears when the inspiratory branch of the P-V loop approaches the total lung volume, indicating that some alveoli and (or) chest wall are over-expanded. ARDS patients are prone to high inflection points. Perioperatively, the sidestream flow (SSS) technology is often used for continuous airway monitoring (CAM). end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-124} end{center} a includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-124(1)} Pleural pressure (mbar) c Figure 11-6 Dynamic pressure-volume loop a.

Restrictive ventilatory disorder begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Flow-volume loop (F-V loop) shows the dynamic relationship between flow rate and volume during breathing (Figure 11-7). It can be monitored by a respiratory function monitor or a multi-function ventilator. item Work of breathing (WOB) monitoring Work of breathing refers to the work done by the respiratory muscles to overcome resistance (airway resistance, elastic recoil of the lungs and chest cavity, and tissue resistance) to maintain ventilation. Normal WOB is $0.4 sim 0.6 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{L}$, accounting for $1 % sim 2 %$ of total body oxygen consumption. It can increase by dozens of times when airway resistance increases and lung and chest compliance decreases. The patient's work of breathing (WOBp) is the work done by the patient's respiratory muscles to contract to deliver a certain amount of gas into the lungs. It can be calculated using the P-V loop measured during spontaneous breathing or mechanical assisted ventilation. The work of the ventilator (WOBv) is the work done by the ventilator to deliver tidal volume to the patient's lungs. It can be calculated using the P-V loop measured during mechanical ventilation. The area of ​​triangle ABC in Figure 11-6 represents the work consumed by elastic resistance during breathing; while the area of ​​semicircle D represents the work consumed by inelastic resistance during breathing. The increase in WOB indicates the increase in lung elasticity and inelastic resistance. It can be monitored by a multifunctional ventilator. {(II) Clinical application of respiratory mechanics monitoring} begin{enumerate} item Airway pressure Airway pressure is a routine monitoring item for mechanical ventilation. Its significance is: end{enumerate} (1) To provide a basis for implementing lung protection ventilation strategies and timely and reasonable adjustment of ventilator working parameters. (2) To judge the progression of the disease and the effect of treatment based on the trend of airway pressure changes. (3) It helps to timely detect abnormal conditions such as disconnection of the breathing circuit, folding of the endotracheal tube, and obstruction of secretions. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Airway resistance Airway resistance is affected by airflow velocity, airflow form and tube diameter. Once an abnormal increase in airway resistance is found during surgery, the cause should be checked immediately and appropriate measures should be taken, such as clearing respiratory secretions, replacing the endotracheal tube, and applying bronchodilators. end{enumerate} {3. Lung compliance} (1) Evaluate the elasticity of lung tissue: Decreased Cst is common in lung parenchymal damage, pulmonary surfactant dysfunction or decreased lung volume, such as ARDS, atelectasis, diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary edema, pneumonia and other restrictive lung diseases; it is also seen in extrapulmonary diseases such as pleural hypertrophy, poliomyelitis, after thoracoplasty, and heart diseases such as mitral stenosis and atrial (ventricular) septal defect. Increased Cst is more common in emphysema and acromegaly. (2) Detection of small airway disease: In the case of small airway disease, Cdyn can decrease significantly with the increase of respiratory rate (called frequency dependence of dynamic lung compliance, FDC). FDC is one of the most sensitive indicators for detecting small airway disease. (3) Guide the adjustment of mechanical ventilation mode and the application of PEEP. {4. Pressure-volume loop (P-V loop)} (1) The shape of the P-V loop can be used to judge certain disease states. (2) During mechanical ventilation, monitoring the P-V loop is of great significance in patients with severe lung diseases (such as ARDS). The low inflection point of the inspiratory branch of the P-V loop is of great significance for selecting the optimal PEEP. It is currently believed that the optimal PEEP is $2 sim 3 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ higher than the low inflection point. The volume corresponding to the high inflection point of the inspiratory branch of the P-V loop can be used as the upper limit of the tidal volume. ARDS patients are prone to high inflection points. To avoid lung injury, the tidal volume should be set below the high breakpoint. (3) The P-V loop can be used to calculate the work of breathing. For patients with respiratory insufficiency, especially those on mechanical ventilation, monitoring WOB is of great significance. However, the use of the P-V loop to calculate the work of breathing has its limitations. The P-V loop cannot calculate the work of breathing when there is no volume change, such as when the airway is significantly obstructed or when there is a high level of endogenous positive end-expiratory pressure. In addition, the different pressure measurement sites also affect the calculation of the work of breathing.\n",
      "{5. Flow-Volume Loop (F-V Loop) The clinical significance of the F-V loop is:} (1) To monitor whether there is any looseness in the respiratory circuit: If there is a leak in the respiratory circuit, the F-V loop cannot be closed and will be open or its area will be reduced. (2) During spontaneous inhalation, the waveform will appear saw-shaped, indicating secretions. (3) Determine the therapeutic effect of bronchial dilation: The change of expiratory flow waveform can reflect the change of airway resistance, so as to determine the extent of bronchial dilation after medication. (4) Monitor intrinsic PEEP: If the flow force is too large and the flow rate is too slow, it will lead to insufficient exhalation, and intrinsic PEEP may occur. The resistance loop cannot be closed. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{5} item Work of breathing (WOB) has the following clinical significance for patients with incomplete respiratory function, especially those on mechanical ventilation: end{enumerate} (1) It can be used to evaluate the respiratory support mode. Adjust the support level of mechanical ventilation and provide an objective indicator for the application of pressure support ventilation (PSV). In order to allow the patient's respiratory muscles to rest completely, a higher pressure support can be used to reduce the work of breathing to zero; For example, the patient is in a period of breathing. The PSY level can be gradually reduced to gradually increase the work of breathing to a normal level to restore the patient's respiratory muscle strength. (2) Guide the patient to breathe in and out. If the work of breathing is less than $0.75 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{L}$, weaning can usually be successful. If the work of breathing is greater than $0.75 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{L}$, it may lead to respiratory muscle fatigue. (3) Determine the degree of respiratory difficulty. When the work of breathing is $0.85 sim 1.15 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{L}$, it indicates a typical increase in the respiratory muscle load; when the work of breathing is greater than $1.25 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{L}$, it is a high-load state that indicates respiratory muscle fatigue. (4) Evaluate the effects of the intubation, ventilator and other treatments on the work of breathing. (5) Find the cause of the increase in WOB to facilitate rapid correction. WOB Increase can be seen in increased airway resistance, decreased chest and lung compliance, improper adjustment of the ventilator's ventilator level, confrontation between the patient and the ventilator, improper choice of ventilation mode, the presence of intrinsic PEEP, etc. (Li Wenzhi Cui Xiaoguang) {Chapter 12 Acute Respiratory Failure} {Section 1 Overview} {I. Concepts} begin{enumerate} item Definition of Acute Respiratory Failure Originally normal respiratory function, acute severe pulmonary ventilation and (or) gas exchange dysfunction caused by various reasons, so that even in the resting state, it is impossible to maintain sufficient gas exchange, resulting in hypoxemia with (or without) hypercapnia, and then causing a series of pathophysiological changes and corresponding clinical manifestations. The syndrome is called acute respiratory failure (ARF). ARF often occurs within minutes to hours, and the body is difficult to compensate in time, so it must be diagnosed in time and rescued as soon as possible to avoid multiple organ damage. The diagnosis of ARF relies on arterial blood gas analysis: when breathing one atmosphere of air at rest at sea level and excluding factors such as intracardiac anatomical shunts, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<60 mathrm{mmHg}$, or accompanied by $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>$ $50 mathrm{mmHg}$, respiratory failure can be diagnosed. Item Definition of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency or failure caused by diffuse pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema caused by damage to pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells during non-cardiogenic diseases such as severe infection, trauma, shock and burns. The pathophysiological characteristics are reduced lung volume, reduced lung compliance, and severe ventilation/perfusion ratio imbalance. Clinically, it manifests as progressive hypoxemia and respiratory distress, and lung imaging shows heterogeneous exudative lesions. In the past, there were many names to describe this disease state, such as shock lung, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. end{enumerate} ALI and ARDS are not a specific disease, but a complex clinical syndrome with dynamic changes. ALI and ARDS are two stages of the same disease process. ALI represents the early and relatively mild stage, while ARDS represents the later and more severe stage. The main significance of proposing the concept of ALI is that it emphasizes that the onset of ARDS is a dynamic process. Patients can be treated early in the ALI stage to improve clinical efficacy. At the same time, patients can be classified according to different development stages (grading the severity of the disease), which is conducive to judging clinical efficacy. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item The relationship between ARF and ALI and ARDS From the definition of ARF, there are many causes, and not all patients have lung lesions. The diagnosis emphasizes the results of arterial blood gas analysis, that is, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<60 mathrm{mmHg}$ under spontaneous breathing conditions, or accompanied by $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>50 mathrm{mmHg}$. The diagnostic conditions of ALV/ARDS are more stringent (see below). Pulmonary changes are a prerequisite for its diagnosis. Patients often have more severe hypoxemia, and conventional oxygen therapy is often difficult to work. Mechanical ventilation is still the main means of respiratory support. Not all ARF patients have ALI, and ALI/ARDS is a special type of acute respiratory failure. end{enumerate} {II. Causes of ALI/ARDS} Common causes of ALI and ARDS are shown in Table 12-1: Table 12-1 Causes of ALI and ARDS begin{center} begin{tabular}{l||l} hline multicolumn{1}{c||}{Risk factors} & multicolumn{1}{c}{Risk factors} hline Pneumonia & severe burns Non-pulmonary sepsis & non-cardiogenic shock Aspiration of gastric contents & drug overdose (heroin, methadone, thiazide, salicylic acid Severe trauma & salt, etc.) Pulmonary contusion & lung injury caused by massive infusion and blood transfusion Pancreatitis & pulmonary vasculitis Inhalation injury (toxic gas, smoke, oxygen poisoning, etc.) & drowning hline end{tabular} end{center} The causes of ALI and ARDS may originate from the lungs themselves or from extrapulmonary organs. The prevalence of ARDS varies significantly with different etiologies. The prevalence of ALI/ARDS can be as high as $25% to 50%$ in severe infection, $40%$ in massive blood transfusion, $11% to 25%$ in multiple trauma, and $9% to 26%$ in severe aspiration. The prevalence of ALI/ARDS further increases when two or three risk factors exist at the same time. In addition, the longer the risk factors last, the higher the prevalence of ALI/ARDS. When the risk factors last for 24 hours, 48 ​​hours, and 72 hours, the prevalence of ARDS is $76%, 85%$, and $93%$, respectively. {Section 2 Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis} {I. Pathological Changes} $ mathrm{ALI}$ The pathological changes are characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is manifested as extensive congestion and edema of the lungs and the formation of hyaline membranes in the alveoli. However, DAD is not unique to ALI, but a nonspecific response of the lungs to multiple damaging factors. The pathological changes of ARDS caused by various reasons are basically the same, and they go through three stages: exudative stage, proliferative stage, and fibrotic stage. The three stages often overlap. The gross manifestation of ARDS lung tissue is dark red or dark purple liver-like changes in the lungs, with visible edema and hemorrhage, a significant increase in weight, and fluid exudation on the cut surface, so it is called \"wet lung\". Under the microscope, congestion, hemorrhage, and microvascular formation of the lungs can be seen, and there is protein-rich edema fluid and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung interstitium and alveoli. After about 72 hours, a transparent membrane is formed by the mixture of coagulated plasma proteins, cell fragments, cellulose and residual pulmonary surfactant, accompanied by focal or large alveolar collapse. Damage and death of type I alveolar epithelium can be seen. After 13 weeks, it gradually transitions to the proliferative and fibrotic stages. Proliferation of type II alveolar epithelium and fibroblasts and collagen deposition can be seen. The transparent membrane of some alveoli is repaired through absorption and dissipation, and some may also form fibrosis. ARDS patients are prone to secondary lung infection, which may form inflammatory changes such as small lung abscesses. ARDS pathological changes have the following characteristics: begin{enumerate} item Heterogeneity of lesion sites ARDS lesions can be distributed in the lower lung or in the upper lung, showing a heterogeneous distribution. In addition, the distribution of lesions has a certain gravity dependence, that is, the lesions in the lower lung area and dorsal lung area are more serious, while the lesions in the upper lung area and anterior lung area are mild, and the middle part is between the two. item Heterogeneity of pathological process Different lesions may be in different pathological stages, and even different parts of the same lesion may be in different pathological stages. item Diversity of pathological changes related to etiology ARDS caused by different etiologies has certain differences in pathological morphological changes of the lungs. In ARDS caused by systemic infection and acute pancreatitis, neutrophil infiltration in the lungs is very obvious. Post-traumatic ARDS patients often have fibrin and platelet microthrombi in the pulmonary vessels, while fat embolism syndrome often causes severe inflammatory changes in small pulmonary vessels. end{enumerate} {II. Pathophysiological changes} ALI and ARDS are caused by damage to the alveolar capillary membrane due to various causes, which increases the permeability of the pulmonary capillaries, causing water and even protein to accumulate in the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, resulting in a series of pathophysiological changes such as decreased lung compliance, reduced functional residual capacity, imbalance of ventilation/perfusion ratio, increased intrapulmonary shunt and severe hypoxemia. begin{enumerate} item Non-cardiogenic high permeability pulmonary edema Under normal circumstances, the pulmonary lymphatic system has the ability to clear excess fluid and protein in the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. When the amount of fluid entering the pulmonary interstitium exceeds the maximum load of lymphatic drainage, the fluid accumulates in the lungs and causes pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema in ARDS is mainly caused by damage to the alveolar capillary membrane, increase or expansion of the gap between endothelial cells, and accelerated speed of fluid and fluid passing through the damaged endothelial cell membrane, causing pulmonary edema. In the early stage of ARDS, fluid accumulates in the lung interstitium, which is called interstitial pulmonary edema. When edema continues to progress, fluid enters and fills the alveoli, which is called alveolar pulmonary edema. Clinically, interstitial pulmonary edema and alveolar pulmonary edema often coexist. end{enumerate} {Chapter 12 Acute Respiratory Failure}\n",
      "{2. Changes in pulmonary respiratory function} (1) Increased intrapulmonary shunt: Due to the insufficient production, secretion and decreased activity of surfactant in type II alveolar epithelial cells, as well as the dilution and destruction of surfactant by alveolar fluid, the lung surface tension increases, the lung compliance decreases, and diffuse alveolar collapse occurs, resulting in increased intrapulmonary shunt, sometimes reaching more than $30%$. The formation of microvascular blood vessels in the lungs, the contraction of pulmonary vessels caused by vasoactive substances, and the compression of microvessels by pulmonary interstitial edema can not only increase pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary artery pressure, but also reduce the blood flow through the alveoli, resulting in ineffective cavity-like ventilation. Therefore, the serious imbalance of alveolar ventilation/perfusion ratio and the increase of intrapulmonary shunt are the main reasons for the progressive hypoxemia in ARDS. (2) Impairment of gas diffusion function: In ARDS patients, due to pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema, hyaline membrane formation, and pulmonary fibrosis, the distance of gas diffusion can be increased, leading to diffusion dysfunction, which prolongs the time for gas to reach equilibrium between alveolar blood (normally 0.3 seconds), resulting in insufficient oxygenation of venous blood flowing through the capillaries around the alveoli, causing increased contamination of venous blood, thereby aggravating hypoxemia. (3) Decreased alveolar ventilation: In ARDS patients, due to pulmonary edema, decreased lung compliance, and obstruction of small airways, the ventilation of some alveoli can be reduced, which is also one of the important causes of hypoxemia in ARDS. The alveoli that are not affected or have mild lesions have compensatory ventilation enhancement, and due to accelerated breathing, excessive carbon dioxide is discharged. Therefore, early patients often show hyperventilation and hypocapnia. In the late stage, the alveolar-capillary membrane damage is more serious, and the pulmonary ventilation is further reduced, which can cause carbon dioxide accumulation and hypercapnia. (4) Decreased lung compliance and increased work of breathing: Lung compliance decreases due to reduced functional residual capacity, pulmonary interstitial edema, congestion of lung tissue, and reduced alveolar surfactant. Lung compliance further decreases as it develops into pulmonary fibrosis. Decreased compliance will inevitably lead to an increase in the body's compensatory respiratory rate and an increase in respiratory muscle oxygen consumption. In ARDS patients, the oxygen consumption of respiratory muscle work sometimes accounts for 30% to 50% of the total body oxygen consumption. (5) Changes in pulmonary circulation function: Increased pulmonary vascular resistance is the main manifestation of changes in pulmonary circulation function in ARDS. Due to hypoxia, acidosis, bacterial endotoxins and vasoactive substances, pulmonary arterioles spasm and contraction; in addition, the attachment of white blood cells and platelets causes blockage of the pulmonary capillary network, which is also one of the factors that increase pulmonary circulation resistance. In the late stage, pulmonary fibrosis destroys the pulmonary capillary bed, increases pulmonary vascular resistance, increases right ventricular afterload, and even causes right heart failure. {III. Pathogenesis} The pathogenesis of ALI and ARDS is complicated and is the result of inflammatory response and uncontrolled immune regulation under the interaction of cellular and humoral factors. In addition to the direct damage to the alveolar membrane by some pathogenic factors, the more important is the pulmonary reaction indirectly mediated by a variety of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, platelets) and the inflammatory mediators and cytokines they release, which ultimately cause alveolar membrane damage, increased capillary permeability, and microthrombosis; it can also cause alveolar epithelial damage, reduce or disappear pulmonary surfactant, aggravate pulmonary edema and atelectasis, thereby causing pulmonary oxygenation dysfunction and leading to refractory hypoxemia. At present, the cellular and molecular biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ALVARDS need to be further studied. Neutrophils gather and activate in the lungs, and release oxygen free radicals, proteases and inflammatory mediators through \"respiratory burst\", and the participation of macrophages and pulmonary capillary endothelial cells is an important cellular mechanism for the pathogenesis of ALJ/ARDS. Under physiological conditions, aging neutrophils are cleared by phagocytes in the form of apoptosis, but current studies have found that many factors that cause ALI can delay neutrophil apoptosis, allowing neutrophils to continue to play a role, causing excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory reactions. Therefore, promoting neutrophil apoptosis may become one of the most promising treatments for ALI/ARDS. In addition to neutrophils, macrophages and vascular endothelial cells can secrete inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-$alpha$ (tumor necrosis factor-$alpha, mathrm{TNF}-alpha$) and interleukin-1 (interleukin-1, IL-1), which play an important role in initiating early inflammatory reactions and maintaining inflammatory reactions. The imbalance of inflammatory mediators and anti-inflammatory mediators in the lungs is a key link in the occurrence and development of ALI/ARDS. In addition to the increase of inflammatory mediators, there is also insufficient release of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. With the introduction of the concepts of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS), people have a deeper understanding of inflammation, a basic pathological and physiological process. According to recent research progress, ARDS can be attributed to the imbalance between SIRS and CARS. SIRS refers to a clinical process of systemic inflammatory response caused by various serious infections, injuries, etc. In the course of ARDS, pathogenic factors act on the body, which can lead to the activation of multiple inflammatory cells and the release of a series of inflammatory mediators, causing damage to the body. But more importantly, these inflammatory mediators can reactivate inflammatory cells, release more inflammatory mediators and cytokines in an autocrine and paracrine manner, form a cascade inflammatory response, and further increase and strengthen the body's injury signals. This inflammatory response is systemic. If the lungs are damaged, it is ALI or ARDS. CARS refers to the body's compensatory anti-inflammatory response accompanied by SIRS caused by trauma, infection, and shock, releasing endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators to fight the inflammatory process, which helps prevent and reduce the body's own tissue damage caused by SIRS. The endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators discovered so far include IL-1 receptor antagonists, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors, and IL-8 autoantibodies. ARDS gradually forms during the development of inflammatory response and can be divided into three stages: (1) Localized inflammatory response stage. Local injury or infection causes the release of inflammatory mediators in the local tissue, inducing inflammatory cells to gather locally, promoting the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and tissue repair, and exerting a protective effect on the body. (2) Limited systemic inflammatory response stage. A small amount of inflammatory mediators enter the circulation and induce SIRS. The increased release of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators leads to CARS, which makes the two in a dynamic equilibrium state. The inflammatory response is still physiological and can enhance local defense. (3) The imbalance stage between SIRS and CARS. The imbalance between the two can be manifested as a large amount of inflammatory mediators released into the circulation, causing a waterfall-like release of inflammatory mediators, while the endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators are not enough to offset their effects, resulting in severe SIRS. Another situation is that excessive release of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators leads to excessive CARS. The consequence of the imbalance is the spread and loss of control of the inflammatory response, which turns from a protective effect to a self-destructive effect, not only damaging local tissue cells, but also attacking distant organs, which can lead to organ dysfunction such as ARDS. {Section 3 Clinical manifestations} {I. Symptoms and signs} begin{enumerate} item Symptoms ALI/ARDS often occurs within 5 days after the onset of primary diseases such as trauma, shock or major surgery, and about half of them occur within 24 hours. In addition to the corresponding symptoms and signs of the primary disease, the earliest symptom is accelerated breathing, with a respiratory rate of up to $30 sim 50$ times/min, and progressive dyspnea. As the symptoms of increased breathing and dyspnea develop, the symptoms of hypoxia become more obvious, and patients often experience irritability, anxiety, sweating, etc. The characteristics of dyspnea in ARDS patients are deep, rapid, and labored breathing, and they often feel tight chest and severe shortness of breath, that is, shortness of breath, which cannot be improved by conventional oxygen therapy, nor can it be explained by other primary cardiopulmonary diseases (such as pneumothorax, emphysema, atelectasis, pneumonia, and heart failure). Item Signs In the early stage of the disease, except for the accelerated respiratory rate, there may be no abnormal signs, or only a small amount of fine wet rales can be heard in both lungs; as the disease progresses, bubbling sounds can often be heard, and there may be tubular breath sounds. In addition, in the late stage of hemorrhoids, it is often accompanied by lung infection, manifested as fever, chills, and other symptoms. end{enumerate} {II. Imaging findings} begin{enumerate} item $ mathrm{X}$ 1-line chest radiograph The early chest radiograph of ARDS patients is often negative, or shows mild interstitial changes, followed by increased lung texture and patchy shadows, and later large consolidation shadows, and air bronchograms. X-ray changes in ARDS often appear $12 sim 24$ hours after the onset of clinical symptoms, and are greatly affected by therapeutic interventions. When a large amount of fluid is resuscitated to correct shock, pulmonary edema is often aggravated, and patchy shadows on $ mathrm{X}$ 1-line chest radiographs increase, while enhanced diuresis can reduce pulmonary edema and shadows; mechanical ventilation, especially positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and other means of increasing mean airway pressure, also increase the degree of lung inflation and reduce shadows on chest radiographs, but gas exchange abnormalities are not necessarily alleviated. item CT Compared with the frontal chest radiograph, CT can more accurately reflect the size of the diseased lung area. The extent of gas exchange and lung compliance lesions can be accurately determined by the range of the lesion. In addition, CT can detect barotrauma and small focal lung infections, which are well correlated with gas exchange and lung compliance. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{III. Laboratory tests} begin{enumerate} item Arterial blood gas analysis Arterial blood gas analysis is the main clinical method for evaluating pulmonary gas exchange. Typical changes in ARDS patients are $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ decrease, $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ decrease, and $ mathrm{pH}$ increase. According to arterial blood gas analysis and inspired oxygen concentration, pulmonary oxygenation function indicators can be calculated, such as alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference $ left[ mathrm{P}_{(A-2)} mathrm{O}_{2} right]$, intrapulmonary shunt $ left( mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{S}} / mathrm{Q}_{ mathrm{T}} right)$, respiratory index $ left[ mathrm{P}_{(A-2)} mathrm{O}_{2} / mathrm{PaO}_{2} right], mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2}$, etc., which are of great significance for establishing diagnosis, severity classification and efficacy evaluation. At present, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is the most commonly used in clinical practice. The specific calculation method is the $ mathrm{mmHg}$ value of $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ divided by the fraction of oxygen inhaled ($ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$, the fraction of oxygen inhaled$). mathrm{PaO}_{2} /$ A decrease in $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is a necessary condition for diagnosing ARDS. The normal value is $400 sim 500$, $ leqslant 300$ in ALI, and $ leqslant 200$ in ARDS. In the early stage, due to respiratory alkalosis caused by hyperventilation, $ mathrm{pH}$ may be higher than normal and $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ may be lower than normal. In the later stage, if respiratory muscle fatigue or combined metabolic acidosis occurs, $ mathrm{pH}$ may be lower than normal, or even $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ may be higher than normal. item Pulmonary mechanics monitoring Pulmonary mechanics monitoring is an important means to reflect the changes in lung mechanical characteristics, which can be monitored by a bedside respiratory function monitor. The main changes include decreased compliance and increased airway resistance. item Pulmonary function test Lung capacity and vital capacity, FRC and residual volume are all reduced; respiratory dead space increases, dead space volume/tidal volume $>0.5$; pulmonary arteriovenous shunt increases. item Hemodynamic monitoring Hemodynamic monitoring is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of ARDS. Cardiac ultrasound and Swan-Ganz catheter examinations help to clarify the heart condition and guide treatment. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) can be measured by inserting a Swan-Ganz catheter, which is a more reliable indicator of left atrial pressure. In general, PAWP $<12 mathrm{mmHg}$, if PAWP $>$ $18 mathrm{mmHg}$, it supports the diagnosis of left heart failure. The hemodynamics of ARDS are often manifested as normal or reduced PAWP. Monitoring PAWP is helpful for differentiating from cardiogenic pulmonary edema; at the same time, it can directly guide the fluid therapy of ARDS to avoid excessive infusion or insufficient volume. item Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and protective bronchial brushing are important means for diagnosing lung infection and bacteriological investigation. Examination of BALF in ARDS patients often reveals a significant increase in neutrophils (non-specific changes), which can be as high as $80%$ (normal is less than 5%). A large number of eosinophils are found in BALF, which is of guiding value for diagnosis and treatment. In addition, measuring the protein concentration in BALF or the ratio of BALF protein concentration to plasma protein concentration can reflect the amount of protein leaking from the alveolar capillaries into the alveoli, which is a common method for evaluating alveolar capillary barrier damage. The capillary permeability of ARDS patients increases, causing a large amount of plasma protein extravasation. The ratio of bronchial fluid to plasma protein osmotic pressure is > $75%$, which is the so-called \"pulmonary capillary leak syndrome\". item Determination of extravascular lung water by transthoracic thermodilution method Impaired alveolar capillary barrier function is an important feature of ARDS. The extravascular lung water content of ARDS patients is significantly higher than that of patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In recent years, hemodynamic monitoring using the pulse indicator continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring system has been widely used in critically ill patients. The PiCCO system combines pulmonary thermodilution with arterial pulse waveform analysis technology, and has the function of continuously monitoring cardiac output and volume indicators, and can monitor changes in vascular resistance and extravascular lung water index. PiCCO is a method that can quantitatively monitor extravascular lung water. The normal value of the lung permeability index, which is the ratio of extravascular lung water to intrathoracic blood volume, is $20% sim 30%$. If it increases, it is a type of increased permeability, i.e., non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In addition, PiCCO can help determine the severity and prognosis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury. end{enumerate} {IV. Stages of ALI/ARDS} begin{enumerate} item Stage 1 (acute injury stage) A few hours after injury, the primary disease is the main clinical manifestation. The respiratory rate begins to increase, leading to hyperventilation, without typical dyspnea. ARDS symptoms may not appear, blood gas analysis shows hypocapnia, and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is still normal or low normal. No positive findings are found in the chest X-ray. item The second stage (relatively stable stage) usually occurs 6-48 hours after the onset of the primary disease, with symptoms of increased and shallow breathing, gradual onset of dyspnea, and moist rales or a small amount of dry rales can be heard on auscultation of the lungs. Blood gas analysis shows hypocapnia, decreased $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, and increased intrapulmonary shunt. X-ray chest films show fine reticular infiltration shadows, reflecting increased fluid accumulation around the pulmonary vessels and increased interstitial fluid content. item The third stage (acute respiratory failure stage) The disease progresses rapidly in this stage, with cyanosis and progressive worsening. Dyspnea worsens, manifested as airway pressure. Increased moist rales on auscultation of the lungs and increased heart rate. $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ further decreases, and conventional oxygen therapy is difficult to correct. $ mathrm{X}$ chest films show typical, diffuse, foggy infiltration shadows due to interstitial and alveolar edema. item Stage IV (terminal stage) Respiratory distress and cyanosis continue to worsen, patients are severely hypoxic, and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as drowsiness, delirium, and coma appear. Blood gas analysis shows severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia, often with mixed acid-base imbalance, which eventually leads to heart failure or shock. $ mathrm{X}$ Linear chest radiographs show large fused shadows, presenting as \"white lungs\" (ground glass). end{enumerate} ARDS caused by different etiologies may have different onset and clinical manifestations. For patients with direct lung injuries such as pulmonary contusion and gastric acid aspiration, shallow and rapid breathing may appear 1 hour after injury, but in patients with sepsis, shortness of breath often appears $3 sim$ 4 days after onset. Most patients have symptoms and signs of acute respiratory failure after $24 sim 48$ hours of onset. In general, the course of ARDS is often acute, but some patients survive the acute phase with treatment and have a longer course of illness, and may eventually die from progressive pulmonary fibrosis, barotrauma, and intractable hypoxemia that is difficult to correct. {Section 4 Diagnosis and Treatment} {I. Diagnosis} begin{enumerate} item Diagnostic Basis The primary disease that causes ARDS is systemic infection, shock, severe lung infection, massive blood transfusion, acute pancreatitis, etc.; respiratory rate, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and cyanosis occur during the course of the disease, and conventional oxygen therapy is difficult to correct hypoxia; blood gas analysis shows progressive decline in lung ventilation function; chest X-ray shows increased lung texture, patchy or flaky shadows with blurred edges, and other lung diseases and left heart failure are excluded. item Diagnostic Criteria The diagnostic criteria proposed by the American-European Joint Conference in 1994 are currently widely used in clinical practice. The criteria are as follows: end{enumerate} (1) Acute onset. (2) Hypoxemia: $ mathrm{ALl}$ $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 300; $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 200$ in $ mathrm{ARDS}$ (regardless of whether PEEP is used). (3) X-ray chest film shows bilateral pulmonary infiltration. (4) Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP $) leqslant 18 mathrm{mmHg}$ or no clinical evidence of increased left atrial pressure. At present, this diagnostic standard has been widely recognized and adopted by many countries including my country. In the past decade, this diagnostic standard has played a huge role in the diagnosis and treatment of ARDS patients. However, there are also some problems in the actual use of this standard. First, the duration of acute onset is not defined, and different doctors have a lot of subjective arbitrariness in making their diagnosis. Secondly, the oxygenation status of patients can change when using different PEEP. In addition, the performance and diagnosis of chest radiographs are also unreliable. Finally, the problem of how to exclude cardiogenic pulmonary edema is also prominent. Clinical monitoring indicators are often inaccurate, and the use of right cardiac catheters is becoming less and less, and PAWP monitoring is also reduced. Even if PAWP is monitored, its value often fluctuates around $18 mathrm{mmHg}$, which is difficult to define clinically, and heart failure is not the only factor causing increased PAWP. In response to the above problems, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine held a meeting in Berlin in 2011 and published new diagnostic criteria in the authoritative medical journal JAMA in 2012 (Table 12-2). This diagnostic criterion was revised on the basis of the above criteria, removing the ALI stage, and instead grading ARDS according to oxygenation indicators under different PEEP and the range of bilateral lung infiltration shown by chest imaging examinations. When excluding cardiogenic pulmonary edema, PAWP monitoring is no longer emphasized. The time range of onset has been clearly defined.

      "{II. Differential diagnosis} ARDS should be differentiated from acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure caused by other reasons. begin{enumerate} item Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is common in left heart failure caused by hypertensive heart disease, coronary heart disease, aortic valve disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, etc. All patients have a history of heart disease and corresponding physical signs. Combined with chest X-ray and electrocardiogram changes, it is generally not difficult to diagnose. It should be noted that cardiogenic pulmonary edema and ARDS can coexist, especially in elderly patients. The formation of cardiogenic pulmonary edema is mainly due to increased pulmonary venous pressure, and the protein content of its edema fluid is not high. The use of diuretics and vasodilators to reduce pulmonary artery pressure can relieve pulmonary edema; ARDS-induced pulmonary edema is mainly due to pulmonary capillary endothelial damage, increased permeability, and a high protein content in its edema fluid. The dyspnea caused by cardiogenic pulmonary edema can often be relieved by oxygen inhalation, but oxygen inhalation is not effective for dyspnea caused by ARDS. item Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema ARDS is a type of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but many other diseases can also cause non-cardiogenic non-edema. For example, excessive infusion, pulmonary venous occlusive diseases such as mediastinal tumors, pulmonary venous fibrosis, decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure such as cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, etc., and other conditions can also be seen in re-expansion pulmonary edema caused by too fast chest fluid extraction. The common characteristics of these patients are that they have a clear medical history, and the symptoms, signs and X-ray signs of pulmonary edema appear quickly and disappear quickly after treatment. Hypoxemia is generally not severe and is relatively easy to correct through oxygen inhalation. However, ARDS patients have more stubborn hypoxemia, and once the lung shadow appears, it is difficult to disappear in a short period of time. item Acute pulmonary embolism thrombus mostly comes from the deep veins of the lower limbs and pelvic veins, and is more common in patients after surgery or long-term bedridden patients. Fat embolism is common in long bone fractures. The disease has a sudden onset, with dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, cyanosis, etc. as the main clinical manifestations. Blood gas analysis showed that both $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ were decreased, which was somewhat similar to $ mathrm{ARDS}$, but chest X-ray examination showed typical round or triangular shadows in the lungs, and the electrocardiogram showed a deepening of the $ mathrm{S}$ wave in lead I, and a large $ mathrm{Q}$ wave and an inverted $ mathrm{T}$ wave in lead II. Radionuclide lung scanning and pulmonary angiography can confirm the diagnosis. item Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with respiratory failure These patients have a history of chronic chest and lung diseases, which often develop after infection; clinical manifestations include fever, cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea and convulsions; blood gas analysis showed a decrease in $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, often accompanied by an increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. ARDS patients had normal cardiopulmonary function in the past, and hypoxemia was the main symptom in the early stage of blood gas analysis, with normal or decreased $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$; conventional treatment could not improve hypoxemia. It can be seen that it is not difficult to distinguish ARDS from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on medical history, physical signs, chest X-ray, lung function and blood gas analysis. The cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is unknown, and the clinical manifestations are irritating dry cough, progressive dyspnea, cyanosis and persistent hypoxemia, and respiratory failure gradually occurs, which can be confused with ARDS. However, the disease has an insidious onset, and most cases are chronic, with a few cases being subacute. Auscultation of the lungs can produce high-pitched, explosive wet rales, which seem to be very superficial, as if they are happening in the ear, and are characteristic. Blood gas analysis shows a decrease in $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, a decrease in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ or no change. $ mathrm{X}$ ray chest radiographs show reticular nodular shadows, sometimes with honeycomb-like changes. Serum immunological examinations often show abnormalities in $ operatorname{Ig} G$ and IgM. Pathologically, it is characterized by pan-interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive ventilation dysfunction and decreased diffusion function. end{enumerate} {III. Treatment} There is currently no specific treatment for ALI and ARDS. The treatment principle is to eliminate the primary cause, support breathing, improve circulation and tissue oxygen supply, prevent and treat complications, and maintain the function of important organs. Treatment can be divided into etiological treatment and supportive treatment. To achieve a breakthrough in treatment, we must explore effective etiological treatment methods and improve supportive treatment measures. {(I) Etiological treatment} begin{enumerate} item Treatment of primary disease The primary disease is the key to the prognosis and outcome of ARDS. Timely removal or control of pathogenic factors is the most critical link in the treatment of ARDS. It mainly includes adequate drainage of infection foci, effective debridement and rational use of antibacterial drugs. item Anti-infection and control of inflammatory response treatment Systemic inflammatory response after infection and trauma is the fundamental cause of ALV/ARDS. Curbing the uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response caused by it is a necessary measure to prevent and treat ALI/ARDS. ALI/ARDS patients are prone to complications of infection, so the possibility of infection should be suspected for all patients unless there are other clear causes of ALD/ARDS. Active prevention and treatment of various infections can avoid further aggravation of lung damage. ARDS is the consequence of excessive inflammatory response of the body, and SIRS is its root cause. Regulating inflammatory response is not only an important means of treating the cause of ARDS, but also may be the key to controlling ARDS and reducing mortality. Studies in recent years have shown that glucocorticoids, prostaglandins $ mathrm{E}_{1}$, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, theobromine, ketoconazole, endotoxin and cytokine monoclonal antibodies may have a certain effect on regulating excessive inflammatory response, but some research results are still controversial, and their therapeutic value in ALI/ARDS is still uncertain, and currently insufficient to support routine clinical application. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Mechanical ventilation support therapy} begin{enumerate} item Objectives and strategies of mechanical ventilation support therapy The main goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain appropriate gas exchange and adequate tissue oxygenation, avoid or reduce interference with hemodynamics, reduce the occurrence of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), avoid oxygen toxicity, and buy time for etiological treatment and repair of lung injury. Early and effective respiratory function support plays an important role in ensuring systemic oxygen delivery and improving tissue cell hypoxia. Once a patient develops hypoxemia, continuous positive airway pressure with a mask should be used first; if the effect is not good, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should be implemented as soon as possible. In recent years, mechanical ventilation for respiratory function support has made great progress, and a systematic strategy for mechanical ventilation treatment has been proposed, which mainly includes the following aspects: end{enumerate} (1) Lung protective ventilation strategy: When treating patients in intensive care units, it was found that some ventilation techniques can cause or aggravate lung injury, namely \"ventilator-related lung injury (VILI)\", so lung protective ventilation strategy is advocated clinically. The core content of this strategy is to use low tidal volume $ left(6 sim 8 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg} right.$ ) or strictly limit ventilation pressure (plateau pressure $ left.<30 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} right)$, and use moderate PEEP ventilation to meet the patient's respiratory needs, avoiding damage to the airway caused by high tidal volume and high airway platform pressure. Low tidal volume ventilation is a requirement and result of pathophysiological changes in ARDS. A large number of studies have shown that conventional or high tidal volume ventilation can easily lead to alveolar over-expansion and excessive airway platform pressure, activate inflammatory cells, promote the release of inflammatory mediators, cause or aggravate damage to alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar capillary endothelial cells, produce pulmonary interstitial or alveolar edema, lead to ventilator-associated lung injury and damage to extrapulmonary organs such as intestines and kidneys, and induce multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Many animal experiments and clinical research results have shown that low tidal volume ventilation can reduce the level of inflammatory factors and alleviate lung damage. When using a low tidal volume, it often leads to an increase in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure $ left( mathrm{PaCO}_{2} right)$, and the adverse effects of increased $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ are mainly caused by changes in the functions of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. After weighing the hazards of VILI and hypercapnia, $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is allowed to increase to a certain extent, which is the so-called \"permissive hypercapnia\". Although there is currently a lack of large-scale randomized controlled studies, small-scale non-randomized trials have shown that it is safe to use small tidal volume and limited airway plateau pressure ventilation with moderate hypercapnia in ARDS. (2) Alveolar recruitment strategy: ARDS with extensive alveolar collapse and pulmonary edema not only leads to refractory hypoxemia, but also causes repeated inspiratory and expiratory collapse of recruitable alveoli to produce shear force, leading to ventilator-associated lung injury. Therefore, promoting the collapse of alveoli and preventing end-expiratory alveolar collapse are of great significance for the treatment of ARDS. The results of large studies have shown that an appropriate level of PEEP can prevent end-expiratory alveolar collapse, improve ventilation/perfusion ratio imbalance and hypoxemia. PEEP can eliminate the shear damage caused by repeated opening and collapse of alveoli. In addition, PEEP can also reduce fluid exudation in alveolar capillaries and alleviate pulmonary edema. Therefore, ARDS patients should be mechanically ventilated with an appropriate level of PEEP. At present, there is controversy over the optimal level of PEEP for ARDS, and its setting method lacks large-scale, prospective, randomized, and controlled studies, and there is no unified standard. Currently, there are two main methods: (1) After the alveoli are fully expanded, PEEP is selected based on the change in $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ caused by the change in PEEP: After the collapsed alveoli are expanded, $ mathrm{PEEP}$ is gradually reduced. When $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ decreases by more than $ mathrm{PEEP}$ compared with the value corresponding to the previous $ mathrm{PEEP}$, it indicates that the alveoli have collapsed again. The PEEP before the $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ decreases significantly is the optimal PEEP. (2) The stress index of the inspiratory branch of the airway pressure-time curve under constant flow rate and volume-controlled ventilation conditions is measured to determine the PEEP level of ARDS patients: when the stress index is $0.9 sim 1.1$, it indicates that the collapsed alveoli are fully expanded, and the PEEP corresponding to this index is the optimal PEEP. In clinical practice, in some cases, PEEP alone cannot reach enough pressure to expand the collapsed alveoli. Therefore, high-frequency ventilation, sigh-like breathing pattern or gradually increasing the mean airway pressure can be used to expand the lung during mechanical ventilation. In addition, higher pressure ( $30 sim$ $45 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ ) can also be given during low tidal volume ventilation or high-frequency ventilation for $20 sim 120$ seconds to fully open the collapsed lung. (3) Keep spontaneous breathing as much as possible: Using a ventilation mode that keeps some spontaneous breathing can partially reduce the dependence on mechanical ventilation, reduce the peak airway pressure, reduce the impact on venous return and pulmonary circulation, and thus increase systemic oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output; it helps to re-expand collapsed alveoli and improve the ventilation/blood flow ratio; it can reduce the use of sedatives and muscle relaxants, preserve the patient's active exercise ability and respiratory sputum discharge ability, reduce interference with hemodynamics and gastrointestinal motility, and help to detect complications early. Of course, there are still some problems with partial ventilation support. For example, spontaneous breathing causes a decrease in intrathoracic pressure, which may increase the alveolar transpulmonary pressure and increase the risk of barotrauma. Further research and observation are needed. (4) Limit the concentration of inhaled oxygen: A large number of studies have confirmed that long-term inhalation of high-concentration oxygen can lead to oxygen poisoning and induce lung injury similar to ARDS. The mechanism may be mainly related to the release of a large number of oxygen free radicals in a high-oxygen environment, thereby damaging lung parenchymal cells; in addition, excessive oxygen concentration may also lead to absorption atelectasis. Therefore, long-term inhalation of high-concentration oxygen can aggravate ARDS. When treating ARDS, the inhaled oxygen concentration should be reduced as much as possible while ensuring adequate oxygenation of the body. $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ should not be higher than $ 60% $. If severe hypoxemia still exists, pure oxygen can be inhaled, but it should not exceed 24 hours. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Selection of ventilation mode Based on the above strategy, a variety of mechanical ventilation modes can be used to treat ARDS patients. It is currently believed that the use of a ventilation mode with decelerated airflow during the treatment of ARDS patients may be more beneficial. Commonly used pressure preset ventilations that support spontaneous breathing mainly include airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), volume support ventilation (VSV) and biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Airway pressure release ventilation can allow spontaneous breathing while limiting pressure, which can reduce the use of sedatives, analgesics and muscle relaxants. VSV is an improved mode of PSV. It can keep the tidal volume constant by automatically adjusting the PSV support level, and has a good application prospect. BiPAP is a ventilation mode that changes the CPAP level at a fixed time, which can support the patient's spontaneous breathing. High-level CPAP promotes alveolar expansion. The pressure gradient of CPAP, lung compliance, airway resistance and conversion frequency determine the alveolar ventilation. At present, BiPAP is considered to be one of the best modes for implementing low tidal volume ventilation. Proportional ventilation (PAV) is a new ventilation mode that can provide auxiliary pressure proportional to the patient's inspiratory airway pressure during the inspiration period without controlling the patient's breathing method. When using PAV, the patient is more comfortable, which can reduce the human-machine confrontation and the need for sedatives. At the same time, it is also conducive to restoring and improving the patient's breathing control ability and adapting to their own ventilation needs. item Some auxiliary methods during mechanical ventilation Due to the gradual understanding of VILI, various methods to improve the effect of mechanical ventilation and reduce its complications are increasingly valued by people. (1) Prone ventilation: It can promote the drainage of secretions and the movement of intrapulmonary fluid, promote the re-expansion of collapsed lung tissue, reduce intrapulmonary shunt, effectively improve the ventilation/perfusion ratio, and significantly improve oxygenation. For patients with severe ARDS who are ineffective with conventional mechanical ventilation, prone ventilation can be considered. Severe hypotension, ventricular arrhythmia, facial trauma, and untreated unstable fractures are relative contraindications for prone ventilation. It is a simple and effective means of mechanical ventilation assistance to improve the oxygenation of ARDS patients. (2) Partial liquid ventilation: On the basis of conventional mechanical ventilation, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) equivalent to the functional residual volume are injected into the lungs through the trachea to eliminate the gas-liquid interface in the alveoli and improve ventilation. Perfluorocarbons have the characteristics of high specific gravity, low surface tension, and strong oxygen-carrying capacity. Therefore, they can promote alveolar re-expansion, improve lung compliance, improve ventilation/perfusion ratio imbalance, and thus correct hypoxemia. (3) Intratracheal insufflation and dead space gas aspiration technology: Under low tidal volume ventilation conditions, it can effectively promote the discharge of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the anatomical dead space and prevent excessive increase of $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. It is mainly used in the implementation and regulation of permissive hypercapnia. (4) Pulmonary surfactant injected through the trachea can reduce alveolar surface tension, help alveolar re-expansion and improve hypochondriasis. However, large-scale clinical observations have shown that the effect is not certain, which may be related to improper administration methods and timing. item Application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in patients with ALI and ARDS Compared with patients with endotracheal intubation, the incidence of ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and severe systemic infection in patients with non-invasive mechanical ventilation is significantly reduced. Therefore, non-invasive mechanical ventilation has gradually begun to be used in ARDS patients. When using this method, it should be noted that the patient selection must meet the following conditions: (1) stable condition, able to cooperate with medical staff, and able to expel airway secretions; (2) no multi-organ system failure; (3) simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) <34 points. NIV is not suitable for the following situations: (1) unconsciousness; (2) hemodynamic instability; (3) significantly increased airway secretions and insufficient airway self-cleaning ability; (4) unable to wear a diaphragm or facial paralysis due to facial deformity, trauma or surgery; (5) upper gastrointestinal bleeding, severe vomiting, intestinal obstruction and recent esophageal and upper abdominal surgery; © life-threatening hypovolemia. In the early stage of ALVARDS in immunocompromised patients, NIV can be tried first. During use, the patient's vital signs and treatment response must be closely observed to prevent serious consequences caused by respiratory arrest. If the patient's $ mathrm{PaO}_{2} / mathrm{FiO}_{2} leqslant 175 mathrm{mmHg}$ after 1 hour of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation and ventilation should be performed immediately. item Use of sedatives, analgesics and muscle relaxants in patients with mechanical ventilation The appropriate and reasonable use of sedatives, analgesics and muscle relaxants can relieve patients' anxiety, agitation, pain and reduce consumption. When using sedatives for mechanically ventilated ARDS patients, the sedation level should be determined and the dose should be adjusted according to the sedation score. Continuous sedation should be avoided, and daily sedation should be implemented when necessary, so that the patient's mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time and total hospital stay time can be significantly shortened. The use of muscle relaxants may prolong the mechanical ventilation time, cause alveolar collapse and increase the incidence of VAP. Mechanically ventilated ARDS patients should try to avoid the use of muscle relaxants unless in severe patient-machine confrontation situations. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(III) Other treatments} begin{enumerate} item Nutritional metabolic support ARDS patients have enhanced catabolism, negative nitrogen balance and insufficient energy intake, which affect the repair of damaged lung tissue. In severe cases, the body's immune and defense functions decline and infection is prone to occur. Therefore, strong nutritional support should be given as soon as possible. Enteral nutrition can prevent intestinal mucosal atrophy and intestinal bacteria and endotoxin translocation, and can be used first. For patients with severe conditions and poor digestive function, total parenteral nutrition can also be used. item Fluid management Fluid management is an important part of ARDS treatment. For ARDS patients, under the premise of maintaining adequate cardiac output, diuresis and appropriate restriction of infusion should be used to maintain a low preload so that PAWP does not exceed $12 mathrm{mmHg}$. The type of fluid replacement in ARDS, such as colloid or crystalloid infusion, has always been controversial. Due to the increased permeability of capillaries, colloid substances can penetrate into the lung interstitium, so it is generally advocated to infuse crystalloid fluid in the early stage of ARDS; when the plasma albumin concentration decreases, colloid fluids such as plasma and plasma substitutes can be infused, and albumin can be used when necessary. For patients with heavy trauma and bleeding, it is best to transfuse fresh blood; when using blood stored for more than one week, a microfilter should be added to avoid micro-clogging and aggravation of ARDS. item Oxygen free radical scavengers and antioxidants Oxidative metabolites play an important role in neutrophil-mediated acute lung injury, so antioxidants are used to treat ARDS. Commonly used substances include protein-based oxygen free radical scavengers and water-based oxygen free radical scavengers. The former includes superoxide dismutase, catalase, etc., and the latter includes allopurinol, mannitol and glutathione, etc. Antioxidants N-acetylcysteine ​​(NAC) and procysteine ​​can provide cysteine, a precursor of glutathione (GSH), to increase intracellular GSH levels and remove oxygen free radicals in the body through GSH oxidation-reduction reactions, thereby reducing lung damage. In addition, soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E and vitamin C can also be tried. item Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support technology developed from extracorporeal circulation. It is a treatment method that draws venous blood outside the body through a membrane oxygenator to arterialize it and then returns it to the patient's body. It can partially or completely replace the lungs and allow the damaged lungs to rest and repair. ECMO is mainly used when the patient's lungs cannot maintain oxygenation to meet the body's needs, such as patients with severe ARDS. ECMO can provide long-term cardiopulmonary support and is most suitable for the treatment of reversible respiratory failure, especially the survival rate of neonatal and pediatric ARDS. ECMO is safer due to the use of heparin to treat membrane oxygenators and tubes, but its application is limited due to the complexity of the technical equipment, high price and large trauma. item Nitric Oxide Inhalation of exogenous nitric oxide can selectively dilate pulmonary blood vessels, reduce pulmonary artery pressure, inhibit platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and theoretically reduce ALI, but its clinical effect is not yet clear. It is recommended to try inhaling NO when other therapies are ineffective. item Maintain the function of important organs and prevent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome Due to factors such as the lungs receiving blood circulation from the whole body and having the most abundant capillary endothelium, ALI and ARDS may be the first manifestations of SIRS. As the disease progresses, multiple organ failure may occur sequentially, and other organs may be damaged due to severe hypoxia, concurrent infection and inappropriate treatment caused by ALI and ARDS, while the failure of extrapulmonary organ function may in turn aggravate ARDS. With strong ventilation support, deaths due to severe hypoxemia are rare, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the main cause of death in the later stage of the disease. Therefore, in the treatment of ARDS, the circulatory function, renal function, liver function and gastrointestinal function should be supported and monitored, such as reducing the cardiac load, strengthening myocardial blood supply, monitoring renal function, preventing and treating gastrointestinal bleeding, monitoring coagulation mechanism and preventing the occurrence of DIC. end{enumerate} (Li Wenzhi Xu Yongmei) {Chapter 13 Respiratory Therapy} Respiratory care is a therapeutic discipline for the support and rehabilitation of cardiopulmonary function. The discipline system is mainly based on cardiopulmonary physiology, pathophysiology and medical engineering, and is formed by the cross-penetration of multiple disciplines such as respiratory and critical care medicine, anesthesiology, physical therapy, rehabilitation and nursing. The core of respiratory therapy is to focus on the support and rehabilitation of cardiopulmonary function. The purpose of respiratory therapy is to improve the patient's respiratory function through various means, maintain the balance of oxygen supply and demand in the body, improve prognosis, and improve the patient's quality of life. Oxygen is a substance necessary for maintaining human life, but the human body itself reserves very little oxygen. The oxygen required to maintain the body's metabolism depends entirely on the respiratory system to continuously absorb from the outside world and transport it to various organ systems throughout the body with the help of the circulatory and blood systems. Any damage to the process of oxygen entering human cells will lead to tissue hypoxia. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt an active and effective respiratory therapy strategy. In most hospitals in my country, respiratory therapy is jointly undertaken by doctors and nurses, and only a few units have professional respiratory care practitioners (RCP). RCP is a professional technician engaged in respiratory therapy. Under the guidance of doctors, they use professional means to evaluate, treat and guide functional training for patients with respiratory dysfunction. The work content mainly includes: establishment and management of artificial airway, adjustment of mechanical ventilation mode and parameters, chest physical therapy, family therapy and health education. Regardless of who undertakes the respiratory therapy work, the patient's demand for this work is unchanged, and these demands are also the focus of the respiratory therapy discipline system. Therefore, under the guidance of a sound discipline system, strict and standardized professional training for RCP is of great significance to ensure the quality of work and improve clinical efficacy. {Section 1 Oxygen Therapy} Oxygen is a special \"drug\" necessary for the body to carry out aerobic metabolism and produce energy. Oxygen therapy (oxygen therapy for short) is to make the patient's inhaled oxygen concentration $left( mathrm{FiO}_{2} right)$ higher than the atmospheric oxygen concentration $(21 %)$ through different oxygen supply devices or technologies, so as to correct hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. The supply process of oxygen from the outside air to tissue cells requires the coordinated action of the respiratory, circulatory and blood systems. The oxygen partial pressure difference between the airway opening and the tissue cells determines the direction of oxygen transport in the body. Oxygen is taken in from the outside atmosphere by the lungs, and after gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood, it is transported to the tissues and organs through the blood circulation. Its partial pressure gradually decreases in a step-like manner, forming a multi-level waterfall-like drop. Therefore, in the process of oxygen exchange and transport, any significant reduction in the oxygen partial pressure difference caused by any reason at any link will lead to hypoxia. As a special drug, oxygen has both beneficial therapeutic effects and may cause adverse reactions and even toxicity. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly control the inhalation concentration and time in combination with the characteristics and changes of the disease to improve the treatment effect and enhance safety. {(I) Hypoxia and hypoxemia} The quality of circulatory function is the key to oxygen delivery, and oxygen delivery (DO2) depends on the degree of arterial blood oxygenation, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, cardiac output, and the ability of tissue cells to utilize oxygen. begin{enumerate} item Hypoxia refers to systemic hypoxia caused by insufficient oxygen at the tissue cell level. The causes of hypoxia are: (1) Hypoxic hypoxia: refers to the decrease in the diffusion rate of oxygen across the alveolar capillary membrane, causing the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to be lower than normal. The causes include: decreased FiO2, increased intrapulmonary shunt, decreased cardiac output, etc. (2) Anemic hypoxia: refers to low hemoglobin content or changes in its quality, causing the blood's oxygen-scavenging capacity to decrease. The causes include: anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, increased methemoglobin content, and rightward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, etc. (3) Ischemic hypoxia: refers to hypoxia caused by insufficient blood perfusion of tissues or organs due to reduced cardiac output, low tissue perfusion pressure or sluggish blood circulation, which cannot deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. (4) Toxic hypoxia: refers to the damage to the ability of tissue cells to utilize oxygen, such as nitride poisoning. Item Hypoxemia refers to $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ being lower than normal. Causes of hypoxemia include low $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$, insufficient alveolar ventilation or pulmonary diffusion disorder, increased true shunt in the lungs and ventilation-perfusion ratio imbalance. If $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is above 0.50, end{enumerate} {Chapter 13 Respiratory Therapy} and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is still below $60 mathrm{mmHg}$, or when $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ increases by 0.20, and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ rises below $10 mathrm{mmHg}$, it is called refractory hypoxemia, which is the result of an increase in the true shunt volume in the lungs. Hypoxemia caused by ventilation/perfusion imbalance responds better to oxygen therapy, and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ can be improved by increasing $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$. {(II) Indications for oxygen therapy} Oxygen therapy should be performed for any tissue oxygenation disorder caused by any reason, but treatment should be targeted at the cause of the hypoxemia or hypoxia. Because oxygen therapy cannot cure all hypoxia. begin{enumerate} item Correcting hypoxemia Oxygen inhalation can increase $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$. When the patient's ventilation function is unimpeded, the alveolar oxygen concentration will also increase accordingly. As a result, the oxygen partial pressure difference between alveolar gas and pulmonary capillary blood increases, which is conducive to the diffusion of oxygen from the alveoli to the blood flow, so that $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ increases. However, when the alveoli collapse completely or the blood perfusion of the alveoli stops completely, gas exchange cannot be carried out. At this time, no matter how high the alveolar oxygen partial pressure is, it is difficult for it to enter the blood. When hypoxemia caused by various reasons such as reduced oxygen concentration or imbalance of alveolar ventilation/blood flow ratio is caused, such as mild hypoventilation, lung infection, pulmonary edema, etc., it is more sensitive to oxygen therapy and has a better effect. For hypoxia caused by other reasons, treatment must be targeted at the cause, such as anemia must be corrected for anemia, and patients with reduced cardiac output must improve the circulatory state. item Blocking adverse reactions caused by hypoxia Hypoxia can cause an increase in respiratory rate and a deeper breathing amplitude to compensate, but the result of compensation is a significant increase in respiratory work and oxygen consumption, and respiratory failure can occur due to respiratory muscle fatigue. When oxygen therapy increases $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ and corrects hypoxia, the vicious cycle caused by hypoxia can be blocked. Similarly, the cardiovascular system responds to hypoxia and hypoxemia by increasing myocardial contractility and heart rate to increase cardiac output and increase the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues. However, the result of compensation is an increase in cardiac work and myocardial oxygen consumption, which may lead to circulatory dysfunction or failure, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease and heart dysfunction, which are more dangerous. Oxygen therapy can block the above compensatory reactions, thereby reducing cardiac work and myocardial oxygen consumption. Item Clinical conditions for oxygen therapy include respiratory failure, heart failure or myocardial infarction, shock caused by any reason, increased metabolism caused by burns, combined injuries or severe infection, patients undergoing resuscitation from cardiac arrest, postoperative patients and carbon monoxide poisoning, etc. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(III) Methods and devices for oxygen therapy} There are many methods and devices for clinical oxygen inhalation, but in terms of the stability and controllability of the delivered oxygen concentration, they are mainly divided into two types: low-flow system and high-flow system. begin{enumerate} item Low-flow system The flow rate of the low-flow system is lower than the maximum inspiratory flow rate when the patient inhales. The patient's minute ventilation cannot be fully provided by the oxygen supply device, but a certain amount of air needs to be inhaled. Therefore, its $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is unstable and is affected by the flow rate of oxygen supply, the oxygen supply device, the anatomical dead space volume of the human body, and the alveolar ventilation. When the oxygen flow rate remains unchanged, if the patient's minute ventilation increases, $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ will decrease, because the proportion of inhaled air increases; on the contrary, if the minute ventilation decreases, $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ will increase, because less air is inhaled. In order to further increase $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$, an air reservoir can be attached to the oxygen inhalation device. At the end of exhalation, the air reservoir can be filled with $100%$ oxygen. When the patient inhales, the air reservoir can supply oxygen to increase $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$. end{enumerate} Commonly used oxygen inhalation methods include: (1) Double nasal cannula oxygen inhalation method: the two openings are inserted into the nostrils on both sides respectively; (2) Nasal cannula oxygen inhalation method: the single-hole cannula is inserted into one nostril or placed in the nasopharynx; (3) Mask oxygen inhalation method: the mask can increase the dead space volume, increase the oxygen storage, and increase $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$; (4) Oxygen reservoir mask: increase the amount of stored oxygen, so that $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is further increased. When using a low-flow system to supply oxygen, the relationship between $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ and oxygen flow rate can be found in Table 13-1. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item High-flow system The gas flow rate provided by this system exceeds the patient's maximum inspiratory gas flow rate, and the patient's minute ventilation is entirely provided by the oxygen supply device. The gas supply flow rate must be at least 4 times the patient's minute ventilation to meet the needs of the maximum gas flow rate during inhalation. High-flow system oxygen inhalation can more accurately adjust $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ and maintain stability. The commonly used method is to use a Venturi mask to inhale oxygen. The principle is that when oxygen flows through a pipe of a specific diameter at high speed, negative pressure is generated around it (i.e., the Venturi effect), and air can enter through the side holes and mix with oxygen to form a higher gas flow rate. By changing the oxygen flow rate, the diameter of the pipe, and the size of the side holes, the flow rate of inhaled air can be regulated to adjust $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}. The relationship between mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ and oxygen flow rate can be referred to Table $13-2$. Table 13-1 Relationship between $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ and oxygen flow rate when low flow system is supplying oxygen end{enumerate} begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} hline Oxygen inhalation method & Oxygen flow rate (L/min) & $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ hline multirow[t]{4}{*}{符管} & 1 & 0.24 hline & 2 & 0.28 hline & 4 & 0.36 hline & 6 & 0.44 hline multirow[t]{3}{*}{面蝟} & 5 & 0.40 hline & 6 & 0.50 hline & 7 & 0.60 hline includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-140} & $7 sim 10$ & $0.7 sim 0.8$ hline end{tabular} end{center} Table 13-2 Relationship between $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ and oxygen flow rate when oxygen is supplied by Venturi mask begin{center} begin{tabular}{cccc} hline $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ & Oxygen/air ratio & Oxygen flow rate( $ mathrm{L} / mathrm{min})$ & Total flow rate( $ mathrm{L} / mathrm{min})$ hline 0.24 & $1 / 25$ & 4 & 104 0.28 & $1 / 10$ & 4 & 44 0.35 & $1 / 5$ & 8 & 48 0.40 & $1 / 3$ & 8 & 32 0.50 & $1 / 1.7$ & 12 & 32 0.60 & $1 / 1$ & 12 & 24 0.7 & $1 / 0.6$ & 12 & 19 hline end{tabular} end{center} {(IV) Complications of oxygen therapy} begin{enumerate} item Acute ventilatory dysfunction often occurs in COPD patients, who usually have $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention and hypercapnia. The medullary respiratory center has adapted to the increase in $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and its respiratory function is mainly maintained by low $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ stimulating the chemoreceptors of the carotid body to cause reflex excitement. If $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is increased to cause a sudden increase in $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, this reflex mechanism can be inhibited, resulting in respiratory depression and hypoventilation. Therefore, when oxygen therapy is given to COPD patients, $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ should be controlled or limited to avoid a sudden increase in $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$. item Absorption atelectasis After inhaling high concentrations of oxygen, nitrogen can be displaced, resulting in the loss of nitrogen support for the alveoli. As oxygen is absorbed, the diameter of the alveoli gradually decreases, resulting in lung collapse or atelectasis. Therefore, $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is safer below 0.5. item Oxygen poisoning Long-term inhalation of $100%$ oxygen can reduce or reduce the activity of alveolar surfactant, inhibit the movement of tracheal cilia, thicken the alveolar wall, and increase the permeability of the pulmonary capillary wall, leading to pulmonary edema. Oxygen is metabolized in cells to produce oxygen free radicals, which destroy alveolar type I cells and are replaced by alveolar type II cells. The early manifestations of oxygen poisoning are edema in the interstitial and alveolar edema, destruction and necrosis of endothelial cells, alveolar congestion and exudation; the later manifestations are exudate absorption and interstitial lesions. The clinical manifestations are refractory hypoxemia, lung collapse and decreased lung compliance. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Chest Physiotherapy} Chest physiotherapy (CPT) is a type of treatment method that uses professional respiratory therapy to dilute and clear sputum in the lungs, prevent and treat atelectasis and lung infection, and improve respiratory function. CPT mainly consists of two basic links: first, loosen sputum, reduce viscosity, and promote its movement from the periphery to the central airway; second, guide or assist patients to cough or simulate coughing movements, strengthen coughing ability, and cough sputum out of the body. If necessary, use negative pressure suction. {(I) Loosening sputum} This part mainly includes: classic techniques such as postural drainage, chest auscultation and vibration, as well as improved techniques such as positive end-expiratory pressure, high-frequency chest wall vibration, airway vibration and intrapulmonary percussion ventilation. begin{enumerate} item Postural drainage is based on the anatomical characteristics of the trachea and bronchial tree, placing the patient in a certain position, and using gravity to promote the movement of sputum in the bronchi of each lobe and segment to the central large airway. The drainage principle is that the lesion site is on the upper side and the drainage bronchus opens downward. The upper lobe drainage can be done in a sitting or semi-recumbent position, and the middle and lower lobe drainage can be done in a head-down-feet-high position, and the body can be rotated according to the different drainage sites. Pollutants should be avoided from draining into the healthy lung. The number of coughs and sputum decreases at night, and sputum is easily retained, so postural drainage in the early morning is more effective. It is suitable for patients with excessive sputum in the airway and weak expectoration; acute exacerbation of COPD, atelectasis, lung infection; bronchiectasis, chronic pulmonary fibrosis with large amounts of sputum; elderly and weak patients who are bedridden for a long time. item Chest tapping and vibration It is suitable for patients with various expectoration disorders, combined with other methods to promote the discharge of sputum. Operation method: end{enumerate} (1) Tap: Bend your palm slightly into a bow shape, put your five fingers together, use your wrist as a fulcrum, and use the strength of your upper arm to tap the patient's chest rhythmically. The tapping amplitude should be about $10 mathrm{~cm}$, and the tapping frequency should be $2 sim 5$ times/second. Repeat $3 sim 5$ minutes for each treatment area. Tap with one or both hands alternately, directly or through clothing (not too thick). Focus on tapping the area that needs drainage, and tap from the periphery to the center along the direction of the bronchus. (2) Vibration: Place both palms together on the chest wall of the lung drainage area, keep both elbows straight, and ask the patient to take a deep breath. While exhaling, use the gravity of the upper limbs to quickly vibrate the chest wall, with a frequency of $12 sim 20$ times/second. Each treatment area should vibrate for $3 sim 5$ minutes. At present, vibrating sputum removal machines have been used in clinical practice and can replace manual clapping and vibration to promote the loosening and discharge of sputum. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Positive end-expiratory pressure refers to the resistance that patients need to resist when exhaling, forming a certain pressure in the airway, thereby maintaining the airway open throughout the exhalation phase, promoting the loosening of sputum and its discharge to the central airway. Generally, $2 sim 4$ times a day, each time not exceeding 20 minutes. It can be performed in groups, with each group having $10 sim 20$ breaths, and $2 sim 3$ guided coughs after each group. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Promoting coughing} Effective expectoration is one of the key links in chest physical therapy. The effects achieved by any other treatment methods, such as loosening sputum and moving it to the central airway, ultimately require the coughing function to expel sputum from the respiratory tract. This link mainly includes: begin{enumerate} item Guided coughing The purpose of coughing is achieved by guiding the patient to cough actively or imitate coughing movements. Guided coughing can enable patients to cough and expectorate correctly and effectively. The specific steps are as follows: (1) The patient sits down, leans forward slightly, and relaxes the shoulders. (2) Take a slow, deep breath. If deep inhalation induces coughing, take a few breaths to inflate the alveoli sufficiently. (3) Hold your breath for 1 second and cough three times with your mouth open, contracting your abdominal muscles while coughing. For patients who are unable to cough, medical staff will place their palms on the patient's lower chest or upper abdomen and apply pressure while coughing. (4) Stop coughing, purse your lips and slowly exhale the remaining gas. (5) Take a slow, deep breath and repeat the above actions. You can repeat more than $2 sim 3$ actions in each training session. item Forced expiratory technique Ask the patient to take a deep, slow breath and then make an active exhalation of $1 sim 2$ small to medium tidal volume. Ask the patient to make a \"ha\" sound to open the glottis. The purpose is to clear the sputum in the large airways and reduce the change of chest pressure and bronchial collapse. It is mostly used for patients with obstructive emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis. item Active breathing cycle is a form of cough training that combines the three techniques of breathing control, chest expansion exercise and forced exhalation in a certain step to achieve the goal of clearing sputum in the airways. It is generally believed that the combination of active breathing cycle and postural drainage has a better effect. It is used for patients with pulmonary fibrosis and can better maintain the patient's oxygenation. item Natural drainage is a modified cough technique that allows the patient to stand and perform diaphragmatic breathing with different lung volumes and expiratory flow rates to clear sputum. Compared with chest thumping and vibration, natural drainage also has similar sputum removal function, and can better maintain the patient's oxygenation, and the patient can tolerate it better. However, this technology is difficult to master and is not suitable for children and critically ill patients. item Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (abbreviated as fiberoptic bronchoscopy) suction When the patient is unable to expectorate, and a large amount of viscous secretions or sputum crusts and blood clots block the airway, the general suction method is difficult to work. The operation under the visualization of the fiberoptic bronchoscopy can not only suck out the sputum in the trachea, but also suck out the millet sputum and dysentery accumulated in the deep lungs and small bronchi due to weak coughing, and the blood clots caused by endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy, which is conducive to maintaining airway patency and reducing lung infection. item Intratracheal drug delivery Intratracheal drug delivery can directly act on the treatment site, with rapid onset, low dosage, few systemic side effects, and significant clinical efficacy. At present, the commonly used intratracheal drug delivery method is mainly nebulization inhalation. Bronchodilators, hormones, expectorants that promote sputum drainage, and antibiotics are the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of inhalation, among which expectorants are more commonly used. Commonly used expectorants in clinical practice include: (1) acetylcysteic acid: a lysolytic agent, its molecular formula contains a thiol group (-SH), which can break the disulfide bonds (-S-$ mathrm{S}$-) in the polypeptide chain and reduce the thickness of sputum; (2) chloramphenicol: it can increase the secretion of serous glands in the respiratory tract membrane and reduce the secretion of mucous glands, thereby reducing the thickness of sputum; promote the secretion of pulmonary surfactant, increase the movement of bronchial cilia, and make sputum easier to cough up. item Heating and humidification of inhaled air The normal upper respiratory tract has a heating and humidification effect on the inhaled air, so that the gas entering the alveoli reaches body temperature and is saturated with water vapor. Patients receiving oxygen therapy or with artificial airways have a partial or complete loss of respiratory heating and humidification functions, resulting in weakened or absent respiratory cilia activity, dry mucosa, dry secretions, and difficulty in expectoration, and even serious complications such as airway obstruction, atelectasis, and lower respiratory tract infection. Therefore, warming and humidifying the respiratory tract is one of the important means of respiratory therapy. end{enumerate} Indications: The purpose of humidification therapy is to reduce or eliminate the humidity difference when patients inhale dry medical gases. Indications include: (1) patients with upper respiratory tract dyspnea: including endotracheal intubation and tracheotomy; (2) patients with hyperventilation: increased minute ventilation, increased airway water loss and increased heat sensitivity; (3) patients with sputum and difficulty expectoration; (4) patients with high fever and dehydration. Standards for heated humidification: There is currently no unified international standard for heated humidification. The commonly used standards are the guidelines developed by the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) in 1987 (Table 13-3).

Respiratory failure can be divided into pulmonary oxygenation dysfunction or failure and ventilation failure. The former is caused by pathological and physiological changes in the lungs, which causes gas exchange disorders between alveolar gas and blood, manifested as hypoxemia. Ventilatory failure mainly affects the discharge of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but it can also be secondary to hypoxemia. The pathogenic factors that cause ventilation failure are shown in Table 13-4.

Indications} {(I) Preventive Mechanical Ventilation} Sometimes, although critically ill patients have not yet developed respiratory failure, judging from the pathological process of the clinical disease, respiratory function, cardiopulmonary function reserve, etc., there are high-risk factors for respiratory failure. Preventive mechanical ventilation can reduce respiratory work and oxygen consumption, thereby reducing the burden on the patient's heart and lungs. The indications are as follows: begin{enumerate} item Patients with high risk factors for respiratory failure, prolonged shock, severe head trauma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients undergoing abdominal or thoracotomy, severe postoperative sepsis, major trauma, etc. item Reducing the burden on the cardiovascular system Patients undergoing major surgery after cardiac surgery, reduced cardiac reserve function or coronary artery insufficiency. end{enumerate} {(II) Therapeutic mechanical ventilation} When patients show signs of respiratory failure, or when they cannot maintain spontaneous breathing and are not expected to recover effective spontaneous breathing in the near future, mechanical ventilation can be used for treatment. {1. Respiratory physiological standards for mechanical ventilation treatment} (1) Respiratory rate (RR) $>35$ times/min. (2) Vital capacity (VC) $<10 sim 15 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$ (body weight). (3) $ mathrm{P}_{( mathrm{A}- mathrm{s})} mathrm{O}_{2}>50 mathrm{mmHg} left( mathrm{FiO}_{2}=0.21 right)$ (4) Maximum suction force (MIF) $<25 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}_{ text {. }}$ (5) $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>50 mathrm{mmHg}, except patients with mathrm{COPD}$. (6) Physiological invalid control/tidal volume $ left( mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{D}} / mathrm{V}_{ mathrm{T}} right)>60 %$ .\n",
      "{2. Indications for mechanical ventilation therapy in different underlying diseases} (1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): After reasonable oxygen therapy for acute deterioration of chronic respiratory failure, there is still $ mathrm{pH}<7.2, mathrm{PaO}_{2}<$ $50 mathrm{mmHg}, mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>75 mathrm{mmHg}$; tidal volume $<200 mathrm{ml}$, respiratory rate $>35$ times/min; and there are early changes of pulmonary encephalopathy. (2) Severe persistent bronchial asthma: After conventional treatment, one of the following conditions occurs: respiratory depression, confusion; respiratory muscle fatigue; $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ gradually decreases and $<60 mathrm{mmHg}, mathrm{SaO}_{2} leqslant 90 %, mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ gradually increases and $>45 mathrm{mmHg}$, blood $ mathrm{pH}<7.25$; general condition gradually deteriorates. (3) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): After oxygen therapy, $ left ( mathrm{FiO}_{2}>60 % right) mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is still lower than $60 mathrm{mmHg}$; or $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is above $60 mathrm{mmHg}$, but combined with respiratory acidosis. (4) Respiratory failure caused by head trauma or neuromuscular disease. (5) Respiratory failure caused by central respiratory depression, when oxygen inhalation does not improve well, or when the respiratory rate is $30 sim 40$ times/min, the cough reflex is weakened, and the sputum is weak. (6) Myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure combined with respiratory failure, when the oxygen concentration has reached $60%$ or more, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is still < $60 mathrm{mmHg}$, mechanical ventilation can be performed with caution. Clinical practice shows that it is difficult to measure lung function in critically ill patients, and it is difficult to use lung function data to determine whether the patient needs mechanical ventilation treatment. Blood gas analysis can provide necessary evidence for ventilation treatment. For example, an increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ( $>55 mathrm{mmHg}$ ) is a direct indication for ventilation treatment. COPD patients can tolerate higher $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. Generally, mechanical ventilation is considered when $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>70 sim 80 mathrm{mmHg}$ and conservative treatment is ineffective. $ mathrm{pH}$ is also an indicator of ventilation treatment. Patients with acute respiratory failure should receive mechanical ventilation treatment when they have severe respiratory acidosis and $ mathrm{pH}$ is lower than 7.25. In short, the indications for mechanical ventilation often vary depending on the type of disease and the specific conditions of the patient. It is difficult to determine a unified specific indicator, and it is necessary to consider the actual clinical condition and treatment conditions. For some patients who have weak cough and sputum expulsion and whose respiratory failure has a greater impact on their overall condition, mechanical ventilation should be used early. When multiple organ failure is found, mechanical ventilation is only considered, which often loses the meaning of rescue. {II. Mechanical ventilation mode} begin{enumerate} item Controlled ventilation (CV) CV means that the ventilator completely replaces the patient's spontaneous breathing, and its frequency, tidal volume or airway pressure, inspiration/expiration ratio and inspiratory flow rate are all set according to preset values. CV is usually used for patients with severe respiratory depression, respiratory failure or respiratory arrest. It can minimize the work of breathing and is conducive to the recovery of fatigued respiratory muscles. However, excessive ventilation or insufficient air intake often occurs when the parameters are set improperly; when the patient's spontaneous breathing is restored and enhanced, human-machine confrontation is likely to occur. If CV is used for too long, it is easy to cause respiratory muscle atrophy and ventilator dependence. Therefore, as long as the situation permits, partial ventilation support should be used as much as possible. Currently, there are two commonly used forms: volume control (VC) mode and pressure control (PC) mode. item Assisted ventilation (AV) AV is when the patient's spontaneous inspiration triggers the ventilator to start delivering air to assist ventilation. AV is synchronized partial ventilation, and the ventilator delivers air according to the preset tidal volume or pressure, frequency and inspiration/expiration ratio. Pressure-switching ventilators provide pressure assistance, while volume-switching ventilators provide volume assistance. AV is a commonly used breathing mode. The key to correct use is to preset the tidal volume or delivery pressure and trigger sensitivity. item Assist-control ventilation (A / CV$) A/CV is a combination of $ mathrm{AV}$ and $ mathrm{CV}$. The patient's inspiratory negative pressure or inspiratory flow triggers the ventilator to deliver air, and the ventilation frequency needs to be set. When the patient is unable to trigger or the spontaneous breathing frequency is lower than the preset frequency, the ventilator delivers air according to the preset frequency and tidal volume or pressure, that is, $ mathrm{AV}$ when triggered and $ mathrm{CV}$ when not triggered. item Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) SIMV is based on the preset respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspiratory time or flow rate, and trigger sensitivity. The ventilator provides positive pressure ventilation to the patient according to the preset instructions, but each air delivery occurs under the trigger of the patient's inspiratory force, and the patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously between two mandatory breaths. SIMV belongs to partial ventilation support, which not only retains the spontaneous breathing function, but also gradually reduces the level of ventilator support, which is conducive to weaning. item Pressure support ventilation (PSV) When the patient breathes spontaneously, the ventilator starts to deliver air at the beginning of the inspiratory phase, and the airway pressure rises rapidly to the preset pressure value, and maintains the airway pressure at this level. When the spontaneous inspiratory flow rate drops to $25%$ of the maximum inspiratory flow rate, the airway pressure returns to the baseline level and exhalation begins. Therefore, during PSV, the patient breathes spontaneously, and the respiratory rate and the ratio of inhalation/exhalation time are controlled by the patient; the tidal volume can be increased, but the increase depends on the pressure and chest and lung compliance; when the same tidal volume is reached, the work of breathing is significantly reduced. PSV is mainly used to reduce the work of breathing during spontaneous breathing of patients, and can be used as a method of evacuating the ventilator. The premise of applying PSV is spontaneous breathing. Patients with insufficient or unstable central drive should not use this mode. item Mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) MMV can be understood clinically as the smallest minute ventilation (SMV) required by patients with ventilator-assisted ventilation. When the patient's spontaneous breathing minute ventilation is greater than the preset value, the ventilator does not provide additional air supply support. When it is lower than the preset value, the ventilator supplies air for replenishment. It is often used for a smooth transition from mechanical intake to fully spontaneous breathing. The disadvantage of MMV is that for patients with shallow and rapid spontaneous breathing, although the ventilation rate has reached the preset value, the dead space ventilation increases and the effective alveolar ventilation is insufficient, which can still lead to $ mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention. item Pressure release ventilation (PRV) PRV increases alveolar ventilation by intermittently releasing PEEP, reducing airway pressure and reducing functional residual air. The advantages of PRV are low peak airway pressure, low intrathoracic pressure, less barotrauma, and less impact on hemodynamics. In theory, the peak airway pressure can be reduced by $30% sim 75%$, thereby reducing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. The disadvantage is that its tidal volume is affected by lung compliance and pressure release time. Under normal circumstances, the pressure release time for adults is about 1.5 seconds, but when airway resistance increases, the pressure release time needs to be extended. PRV is usually used in combination with PSV, because the patient has to overcome the airway resistance of the ventilator circuit, which increases the work of breathing. The application of $5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ inspiratory pressure support can prevent patients from experiencing plateau muscle fatigue and increase comfort. item Biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) CPAP is a system in which the airflow rate is higher than the airflow rate during spontaneous breathing and inspiration when the patient breathes spontaneously through a high-speed airflow system, resulting in the airway pressure in both the exhalation and inspiration phases being greater than atmospheric pressure. CPAP can prevent alveolar collapse, increase functional residual capacity, and improve lung compliance and oxygenation. BiPAP, on the basis of CPAP, provides two different levels of high and low pressure during the exhalation/inhalation phases. By switching between the two pressure levels, changes in respiratory capacity are caused to achieve the purpose of assisted ventilation. Both modes can be implemented under the conditions of invasive and non-invasive ventilation. item Pressure-regulated volume control ventilation (PRVCV) The ventilator can adjust and control the airway pressure according to the compliance of the respiratory system measured by the microcomputer on the basis of ensuring the preset tidal volume and minute ventilation, so as to achieve the best alveolar ventilation with the lowest airway pressure. PRVCV has the advantages of pressure support, but it is still volume control. The inspiratory airflow waveform of PVRCV is decreasing. When the airway resistance increases, the decreasing waveform can increase the laminar flow component of the gas, reduce the airway resistance and peak pressure value, and keep the alveolar ventilation unchanged. The advantages of PRVCV are good synchronization performance, reduced human-machine confrontation; stable tidal volume; reduced airway peak pressure, reduced lung damage and disturbance to circulatory function; patient comfort, and reduced use of sedatives and muscle relaxants. item Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) ASV uses a microcomputer control system to comprehensively monitor the patient's real-time situation, automatically adjust and set the ventilator parameters to adapt to the patient's respiratory capacity and ventilation needs. This mode can adapt to patients with or without autonomous breathing ability. When the patient is unable to breathe or central respiratory arrest occurs, ASV automatically provides mandatory ventilation; when the patient's autonomous breathing function is restored, ASV automatically switches to support ventilation. Whether it is controlled ventilation or support ventilation, ASV provides the lowest airway pressure and the best respiratory rate to adapt to the patient's ventilation goals under the patient's current respiratory state. Its advantages: wide adaptability; strong automatic adjustment ability, which is conducive to early weaning; reducing complications, such as mechanical ventilation-related lung injury. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{III. PEEP} During normal spontaneous breathing, the airway pressure at the end of exhalation is zero, which is equal to atmospheric pressure. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) means that at the end of the exhalation phase, the airway pressure is still higher than atmospheric pressure. begin{enumerate} item Effects of PEEP on lung function (1) PEEP can promote the movement of interstitial water from areas with poor lung compliance to interstitial water with better compliance (such as around the bronchus and hilar area), improving lung compliance and oxygen diffusion. (2) Increase FRC: PEEP can expand small open alveoli and re-expand collapsed alveoli, resulting in an increase in FRC. Its effect is related to the level of PEEP. When PEEP is below $10 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, its main function is to expand the alveoli; and to expand the collapsed alveoli again, the required PEEP should generally be greater than $10 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$. (3) Effect on lung compliance: In ARDS patients, the lung compliance curve shifts to the lower left due to alveolar collapse, that is, compliance decreases. After the application of PEEP, the collapsed alveoli can be expanded again, and the lung compliance curve shifts to the upper right. Especially when the PEEP size is appropriate, the curve can be close to the normal FRC level, which significantly improves lung compliance. (4) Effect on oxygenation function: In ARDS patients, the application of PEEP treatment can expand the alveoli with poor ventilation and expand the collapsed alveoli again, resulting in reduced pulmonary shunt and significantly improved oxygenation status. If PEEP is applied appropriately, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ can be doubled. (5) Effect on dead space ventilation: PEEP can cause normal alveoli to over-expand, compress surrounding blood vessels and reduce perfusion, resulting in increased dead space ventilation. When appropriate PEEP is applied to diseased alveoli, the expansion and re-expansion of the alveoli can improve the ventilation/perfusion ratio (V/Q), but has no significant effect on dead space ventilation. item Effect of PEEP on cardiac output (1) Reduced venous return: PEEP can increase intrathoracic pressure, resulting in obstruction of systemic venous return, which can reduce the heart's stroke volume and cardiac output. (2) Reduced right ventricular ejection function: PEEP can increase intrathoracic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, increasing the afterload of the right ventricle. When PEEP is too high or myocardial contractility is abnormal, the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) can be significantly reduced. (3) Effect on left ventricular function: PEEP can increase the afterload and volume of the right ventricle, causing the ventricular septum to shift to the left, resulting in changes in the shape, volume and end-diastolic pressure of the left ventricle. As a result, the filling of the left ventricle is affected, resulting in a decrease in cardiac output. (4) PEEP can reduce coronary blood flow: This may be due to increased intrathoracic pressure, which compresses the heart and coronary arteries. It may also be related to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption. end{enumerate} {3. Indications for the use of PEEP} (1) Patients with acute respiratory failure often have early closure of small airways, atelectasis, and increased intrapulmonary shunt. PEEP treatment can restore lung capacity, increase $ mathrm{FRC}$, prevent atelectasis, and increase $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$. When $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is higher than 0.6 and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is still unable to maintain $ mathrm{mmHg}_{2}$ higher than $ 60 mathrm{mmHg}$, PEEP treatment should be selected. (2) Patients with ARDS and acute lung injury often suffer from severe hypoxemia and should be treated with PEEP. (3) For those who have established an artificial airway, it is also recommended to use a PEEP of $ 5 sim 10 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, which can prevent the decrease of functional residual capacity (FRC) during artificial airway breathing and improve oxygenation function. (4) For patients with pulmonary edema, the use of a PEEP of 5 $ 10 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ can prevent early closure of small airways, which is beneficial to oxygenation and reduces the work of breathing. (5) For patients after abdominal and intrathoracic surgery, the application of PEEP can not only prevent the occurrence of postoperative low lung volume syndrome and improve oxygenation function, but also reduce postoperative pulmonary development syndrome. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item The clinical application of PEEP generally starts with $5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, and the size of PEEP is adjusted according to changes in lung function, circulatory function, renal function and central nervous system function, and can be increased or decreased by $2 sim 5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ each time. It is difficult to determine the appropriate PEEP. It is generally believed that PEEP should not exceed $15 sim 20 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$. The ideal PEEP should achieve: (1) maximum lung compliance; (2) minimum intrapulmonary shunt; (3) maximum oxygen transport; (4) minimum $ mathrm{FiO}_{2} (<0.5$ or 0.6$). $ end{enumerate} {IV. Complications of mechanical ventilation} {1. Lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation Mechanical ventilation-related lung injury includes:} (1) Capacitive/barotropic injury: direct damage to alveoli and increased permeability of alveolar-capillary membranes due to excessive expansion of alveoli or increased intrapulmonary pressure. The ventilation strategy of implementing a small $V_{ mathrm{T}}$ and permissive hypercapnia for ARDS patients is based on avoiding excessive expansion of alveoli. (2) Biological injury: damage to the lungs or other organs due to the production and release of inflammatory mediators into the alveoli or systemic circulation. (3) Atelectasis injury: lung injury caused by incomplete expansion or collapse of alveoli. The shear force generated by repeated expansion and collapse of alveoli can cause pneumonia and increase the permeability of alveolar-capillary membrane. For ARDS patients, this mechanism of injury may be more prominent. The application of appropriate PEEP can avoid the damage of shear force to lung tissue, usually $10 sim 15 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}_{ text {。 }}$ 。 begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Effect on systemic circulation Positive pressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure, reduces venous return, and reduces right ventricular preload. At the same time, when alveolar pressure exceeds pulmonary venous pressure, it will cause increased pulmonary circulation resistance and increased right ventricular afterload, resulting in reduced right heart output. Since the mean airway pressure is the main factor affecting hemodynamics, if PEEP is not applied appropriately, the impact on circulation will be more obvious, often manifested as reduced cardiac output and decreased blood pressure. Supplementing blood volume can counteract the effect of PEEP on hemodynamics. The reduction of right heart output and the restriction of left ventricular relaxation affect the filling of the left ventricle. However, the effect of mechanical ventilation on left heart output varies according to the patient's condition. In patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the left ventricle is already in an overfilled state. The reduction of left ventricular preload caused by positive pressure ventilation will shift the left heart function curve to the left and increase left heart output. end{enumerate} Many types of arrhythmias may occur during mechanical ventilation, among which ventricular and atrial premature beats are the most common. The causes are related to hypotension, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, electrolyte imbalance and irritability. If arrhythmias occur, the cause should be actively sought and targeted treatment should be carried out. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Effect on cerebral blood flow PEEP increases intrathoracic pressure, obstructs internal jugular vein return, and increases intracranial pressure (ICP). Combined with the decrease in MAP caused by PEEP, the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) decreases $($ CPP $=$ MAP-ICP). For individuals with a sound self-regulatory mechanism for cerebral blood flow, a decrease in CPP within a certain range will not cause a decrease in cerebral blood flow. For patients with impaired self-regulatory mechanisms, such as severe craniocerebral trauma, cerebral blood flow will decrease with the decrease in CPP, which may cause secondary ischemic damage. Therefore, for patients with brain injury, ICP should be monitored while mechanical ventilation support is being carried out, with the aim of evaluating cerebral blood perfusion. Item Nosocomial infection Mechanically ventilated patients have a lowered resistance, the use of spectrum antibiotics and hormones, the establishment of artificial airways, and suctioning of sputum, which can increase the chance of contamination. Nosocomial infections in mechanically ventilated patients are mainly bronchopulmonary infections (ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP) and infections around artificial airways, epidemiology, otitis media, and possible secondary systemic infections. Among them, VAP is the most serious, accounting for $90%$ of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the ICU, and the mortality rate of VAP is 2-10 times higher than that of common HAP. end{enumerate} Common pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter or Pseudomonas), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungi. The infiltration shadows of bronchopulmonary infection on the $ mathrm{X}$ axial chest radiograph are sometimes difficult to distinguish from pulmonary interstitial edema, small focal atelectasis, pulmonary infarction, pulmonary hemorrhage, gastric content aspiration, etc. Dynamic monitoring of sputum culture results, sputum collection with a fiberoptic protected brush (PSB) and culture of fluid after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are very helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, antibiotics should be selected for treatment based on drug sensitivity results. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Oxygen poisoning Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen will produce toxic effects on the body, i.e. oxygen poisoning. Oxygen poisoning can occur in the central nervous system, erythropoietic system, endocrine system and respiratory system. For patients on mechanical ventilation, the most prominent manifestation is in the respiratory system, and its mechanism of action is mainly the damage of the alveolar epithelium to the alveolar epithelium by a large number of oxygen free radicals produced by high concentrations of oxygen and the inflammatory cells induced. The key to oxygen poisoning is prevention, and $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ should be controlled below $50 %$ as much as possible. end{enumerate} {V. Weaning of mechanical ventilation} Weaning of mechanical ventilation refers to the process of transitioning from mechanical ventilation to completely autonomous breathing for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation treatment. In order to successfully evacuate the ventilator, it is necessary to correctly judge the patient's respiratory function and general condition, and grasp the timing of weaning.\n",
      "{(I) Standards for weaning from mechanical ventilation} begin{enumerate} item General clinical conditions (1) Stable circulatory function, blood pressure and heart rate are basically within the normal range, organ and tissue perfusion is good, there is no serious arrhythmia, and vasoactive drugs are not used or used in small amounts; (2) Severe infection is effectively controlled; (3) Severe metabolic disorders have been corrected, including fluid, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, especially plasma potassium, sodium, sodium and calcium should be maintained within the normal range; (4) There are no serious respiratory movement disorders; (5) The original cause of the need for mechanical ventilation has basically recovered. item Respiratory function measurement The respiratory parameters measured are used to determine whether the ventilator can be removed, when to start weaning from the ventilator or when to completely wean from the ventilator (Table 13-5). end{enumerate} Table 13-5 Criteria for weaning from the ventilator begin{center} begin{tabular}{lcc} hline multicolumn{1}{c}{Parameter} & Start weaning & Complete weaning hline Vital capacity $( mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg})$ & $ geqslant 5$ & $ geqslant 15$ Maximal inspiratory force $ left( mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} right)$ & $ geqslant 10$ & $ geqslant 25$ $ mathrm{PEEP} left( mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O} right)$ & $ leqslant 10$ & $ leqslant 5$ $ mathrm{P}_{( mathrm{A}- mathrm{a})} mathrm{O}_{2}( mathrm{mmHg})$ & $<350 left( right.$ suck $ left. mathrm{O}_{2} right)$ & $<350 left( right.$ suck $ left. mathrm{O}_{2} right)$ $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}( mathrm{mmHg})$ & $>60 left( right.$ suck $ left. mathrm{O}_{2} right)$ & $>60 left( right.$ suck $ left. mathrm{O}_{2} right)$ $ mathrm{pH}$ & $ geqslant 7.30$ & $ geqslant 7.30$ Respiratory rate $( mathrm{bpm})$ & $<45$ & $<35$ Minute ventilation $( mathrm{L} / mathrm{min})$ & $<18$ & $<10$ hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Other factors (1) The function of the central nervous system is basically restored, the patient is conscious and cooperative, and the cough and swallowing reflexes are restored; (2) The nutritional status is good, but excessive intake of sugars should be avoided to increase the production of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$; (3) The patient's ability to move actively is basically restored, such as being able to turn over or sit up by himself, etc. The patient should be helped to change his position or move actively. end{enumerate} {(II) Ventilator Weaning Methods} begin{enumerate} item $ mathrm{T}$ Tube Oxygen Inhalation Method Let the patient breathe spontaneously after being weaned from the ventilator, and inhale oxygen through a $ mathrm{T}$ tube for a period of time, and then mechanically ventilate for a period of time, alternating between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, and gradually prolonging the spontaneous breathing time until the patient is completely weaned from the ventilator. During spontaneous breathing, the function of the respiratory muscles should be closely observed and evaluated. When respiratory muscle fatigue occurs, mechanical ventilation should be performed immediately to restore respiratory muscle strength. item CPAP Weaning Method CPAP and T-tube oxygen inhalation are different, and the treatment effects are also different. Because CPAP has a demand valve, spontaneous breathing through the valve can slightly increase the work of breathing, which can sometimes cause respiratory muscle fatigue. However, when the patient's lung capacity is low or PEEP therapy is still needed to maintain an appropriate $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, CPAP is a better choice. item SIMV weaning method is currently the most commonly used weaning method. Because SIMV allows patients to breathe spontaneously, when the weaning criteria are met, the frequency of SIMV can be gradually reduced until the patient is completely weaned from the ventilator. Because SIMV can maintain the vitality of the respiratory muscles, reduce the use of sedatives, and maintain an appropriate ventilation/perfusion ratio, it is a safer method to transition from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing. item PSV weaning method When using PSV to wean, a certain pressure is initially adjusted to obtain sufficient tidal volume. Then, on the basis of maintaining an appropriate alveolar ventilation star, the pressure is gradually reduced and the patient transitions to fully spontaneous breathing. In clinical practice, PSV is often used in combination with SIMV to reduce the patient's work of breathing during spontaneous breathing and gradually reduce the frequency of SIMV. Then the pressure of PSV is reduced to achieve the purpose of completely weaning from the ventilator. item Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) weaning NIPPV refers to assisted mechanical ventilation without the need to establish an artificial airway. NIPPV can be used to appropriately advance the time of removing the endotracheal tube for weaning to reduce complications caused by the artificial airway. It is especially suitable for COPD patients who have established invasive artificial airways for mechanical ventilation due to bronchopulmonary infection and respiratory failure. end{enumerate} In short, various weaning methods have certain advantages and disadvantages. However, there is currently no method that is suitable for all cases. Most cases can be successfully weaned using the above methods, but some cases with difficulty in weaning are also encountered. If weaning is difficult or unsuccessful using a certain method, other methods can be tried. As long as the weaning standards are basically met, weaning will always be successful.

Basic Concepts and Principles} {(I) Basic Concepts} Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in a broad sense: blood is drawn from the body to the outside of the body, and then injected into the body after physical and chemical treatment. It is mainly used for life support, organ replacement and function regulation. Extracorporeal circulation in a narrow sense (also known as cardiopulmonary bypass, CPB): blood is drawn from the body to the outside of the body for gas exchange and (or) circulation, thereby replacing or assisting circulatory and respiratory functions. It is mainly used for open heart surgery. {(II) Basic Principles} As shown in Figure 14-1, unoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium (or the superior and inferior vena cava) to the venous return chamber by gravity through the venous tube. There is an oxygen saturation monitoring device on the drainage tube, which can continuously monitor and judge the balance of oxygen supply and oxygen consumption in the body. There is a flow control device on the venous drainage tube to control the venous return volume or cardiac filling. The venous return chamber receives blood (or fluid) from both extracardiac suction and intracardiac suction. Extracardiac suction is commonly known as right heart suction. Generally, blood (or fluid) outside the cardiac cavity or in the surgical field is sucked into the return chamber through a suction head and a roller spring. Intracardiac suction (i.e. left heart suction) is generally placed in the left atrium with a special catheter. Non-visible blood in the heart is sucked into the return chamber through a roller spring, which can prevent the left heart from expanding. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-149} end{center} Figure 14-1 Schematic diagram of CPB principle The thermostat is generally integrated with the oxygenator. The blood in the return chamber is injected into the thermostat and oxygenator through a roller spring or a centrifugal spring. The gas mixer sends a certain concentration of oxygen to the oxygenator so that the blood can be oxygenated in it. The blood in the oxygenator passes through the arterial filter to remove the oxygen and enters the patient's body through the arterial cannula. There are also saturation monitoring devices and bubble monitoring devices in the arterial pipeline. The arterial filter is connected to a pressure monitoring device and a circulating exhaust pipeline. In order to protect the myocardium, a special roller spring and pipeline are responsible for the perfusion of crystalloid and blood flow mixed cardioplegia fluid. There is also a pressure monitoring device in its pipeline. In addition, in order to maintain water and electrolyte stability, an ultrafilter can be installed on the above pipeline. {II. Main devices of CPB} Here we mainly introduce the full oxygenator and the perfusion spring. {(I) Oxygenator} One of the tasks of CPB in open heart surgery is to synthesize venous oxygen into arterial blood. This process is completed by an artificial lung (oxygenator). Currently, there are mainly bubbling oxygenators and membrane oxygenators (referred to as \"membrane lungs\"). begin{enumerate} item Bubble oxygenator The bubble oxygenator consists of an oxygenation chamber, a temperature change device, a debubbling device, and a blood storage chamber. Oxygen is mixed with blood in the oxygenation chamber to form countless micro blood bubbles, and the blood temperature is changed at the same time, and then the debubbling device becomes oxygen-rich arterial blood. The oxygenation chamber is the key part of the bubble oxygenator. The gas on one side enters the blood on the other side through the bubble plate to form micro bubbles. Pure oxygen is blown into the blood through the bubble plate to form countless micro blood bubbles, which provides a rich area for gas exchange in the blood. According to the principle of gas exchange, because the $ mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of venous blood is low and the $ mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is high, oxygen is taken into the bubble during the blood bubble formation process and carbon dioxide is discharged. When the blood bubbles flow through the filter containing silicone oil, the blood bubbles disappear and become arterial blood. During CPB, the temperature needs to be lowered due to many factors, such as circulatory arrest and low flow rate. At the end of CPB, the body temperature needs to be restored to normal. This requires the oxygenator to have a strong temperature change capability. In general, the temperature change device and the oxygenator are integrated. After the process of bubbling, oxygenation, temperature change, and debubbling, the blood enters the blood storage chamber through the filter and is finally injected into the human body through the arterial spring. The bubbling oxygenator has a large pre-fill volume, which causes severe damage to the blood and can cause a high inflammatory response to the patient. The residual oxygenation performance is also limited, and it is now used less and less. item Membrane oxygenator (membrane lung) The design of the membrane lung is based on the breathing method of the lungs. The gas exchange in the membrane lung is divided into three steps: (1) The gas is absorbed and dissolved on one side of the membrane; (2) The gas diffuses in the membrane; (3) The gas is released from the other side of the artificial membrane. end{enumerate} The diffusion process of the gas is carried out according to Fick's law. The polypropylene microporous film has a strong gas permeability. When blood contacts the microporous membrane, slight changes in plasma and platelet adhesion occur immediately. An extremely thin protein film is formed on the microporous membrane, isolating blood from gas, facilitating gas diffusion, and reducing plasma protein denaturation and platelet adhesion. The shapes of the micropores on the film are different. The smaller the pores, the larger the unit pore area, and the stronger the gas exchange capacity. At the same time, the protein membrane attached to the pores can withstand great pressure and is not prone to plasma leakage. Blood flows outside the hollow fiber tube and gas flows inside the tube, which is a good way to solve the laminar flow and resistance of blood. Blood does not move in a straight line during flow, but constantly changes direction, so that blood cells and plasma are fully mixed to achieve the best oxygenation per unit area. The oxygenation reliability is high, and at the same time, the amount of hollow fiber used is greatly reduced, and the pre-filling amount of the oxygenator is reduced (Figure 14-2). The oxygenation principle of membrane lung is similar to that of human lung. There is no direct contact between air and blood. There is no bubble generation and elimination process of bubble oxygenator, which causes less damage to red blood cells. Membrane lung can reduce the consumption of platelets. Complement is activated in large quantities in CPB, and acts on specific receptors on the membrane of leukocytes to aggregate leukocytes and deposit in large quantities in the pulmonary capillaries. The chemotaxis of leukocytes is enhanced, and inflammatory mediators such as lysosomal enzymes and histamine are released to increase vascular permeability, which is closely related to postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome. Membrane lung can reduce the activation of complement in CPB, thereby reducing the deposition of leukocytes in pulmonary capillaries. This has positive significance in reducing CPB pulmonary complications. In short-term CPB, there is no significant difference between membrane lung and bubble oxygenator, but in long-term perfusion, the advantages of membrane lung can be fully reflected (Table 14-1).

      "{(II) Perfusion record} The perfusion spring is a driving device for blood. The main perfusion springs currently used are roller springs and centrifugal springs. begin{enumerate} item Roller spring Roller spring is the most commonly used spring for CPB. It consists of a spring tube and a spring head. The spring head is divided into two parts: a rolling shaft and a spring groove. The spring tube is placed in the spring groove. The rolling shaft squeezes the outer wall of the spring tube in a fixed direction to push the liquid in the tube to flow in a certain direction. The spring tube must have good elasticity and anti-extrusion ability. Currently, there are three main types of pipes: silicone, silicone plastic and plastic. The roller generally has two rolling shafts with the same center and equal distance. It can rotate by itself and reduce friction during rolling. The spring groove is semicircular, with the same center as the rolling shaft, and the surface is smooth. During the perfusion process, the rolling shaft is adjustable, that is, it can reach more than 200 revolutions per minute at a fast speed and 1 revolution per minute at a slow speed. The rolling is uniform and noiseless. The flow rate of the pump is proportional to the pedal speed and the inner diameter of the pump tube. The larger the inner diameter of the pump tube, the more flow rate per rotation of the roller. Generally, large-diameter pump tubes are suitable for adults, and small-diameter pump tubes are suitable for children. Because when the inner diameter of the tube is small and the flow rate is large, the number of rotations of the roller shaft increases, the chance of blood squeezing increases, and blood damage can be aggravated. When the inner diameter of the tube is large and the flow rate is small, it is not conducive to fine adjustment of the flow rate. The way to overcome this is to use a pump tube with an appropriate diameter and ensure a certain speed. The pump flow rate is the amount of blood discharged by the roller shaft in one circle of the pump tube multiplied by the speed per minute. Due to the different inner diameters of the pump tubes, the flow rate needs to be accurately calibrated when replacing a new pump tube. The pump tube should be stretched when placed in the pump tank and fixed at both ends of the inlet and outlet of the pump tank. Pay attention to the direction when installing the pump tube. If it is installed in reverse, serious consequences will occur. For example, if the aortic pump tube is installed in reverse, blood will be withdrawn, and if the intracardiac suction pump tube is installed in reverse, gas will be injected into the heart. item Centrifugal spring When an object with a certain mass moves in concentric circles, it generates centrifugal force, which is proportional to the speed and mass. When the liquid in the container moves in a high-speed circle, the centrifugal force is limited by the container wall, and the liquid will extend upward along the container wall. If the container is sealed, the liquid will exert a strong pressure on the container periphery. Based on the above physical phenomenon, people designed centrifugal springs. In a high-speed moving device, the center of the circle of the liquid is a negative pressure area, and the periphery is a high pressure area. If a hole is opened in the center and periphery of the cavity, the liquid will flow due to the pressure difference. When the peripheral pressure is higher than the resistance outside the cavity, the liquid can produce unidirectional movement. end{enumerate} Centrifugal springs can be divided into a driving part and a control part. See Table 14-2 for a comparison of the characteristics of centrifugal springs and rolling springs. Table 14-2 Performance comparison of centrifugal springs and roller-pressed springs begin{center} begin{tabular}{lll} hline & multicolumn{1}{c}{Centrifugal Spring} & multicolumn{1}{c}{Roller-pressed Spring} hline Flow rate & Positively correlated with speed and pressure & Fixed relationship with speed Type & Open, pressure-limited & Closed, limited Blood damage & Mild & Severe Microembolism & Cannot & Can Accidental exhaust & Cannot & Can Distal blockage & Limited increase in pipeline pressure & Increase in spring tube pressure to the point of rupture Long-term perfusion & Suitable & Unsuitable Maneuverability & Good & Poor Blood backflow & May occur when the speed is not enough & Will not occur hline end{tabular} end{center} Blood enters the high-speed rotating centrifuge and can generate powerful kinetic energy to drive the body. The inner surface of the centrifugal pump is smooth, which can reduce the interface friction caused by blood entering it, avoid excessive pressure, and make the centrifugal spring damage the blood slightly. The centrifugal pump can be regarded as an open spring without valves. When the centrifugal force generated by high-speed rotation is higher than the output resistance, the blood is transfused into the body. The higher the speed of the pump, the greater the pressure generated, and the higher the output of the pump. It is also affected by the resistance at the output end. If the peripheral resistance is high, the flow rate will decrease accordingly. This is pressure dependence. If the pipe at the output end of the pump is kinked and closed, the pressure in the pipe will rise and it will not collapse easily, because the centrifugal pump is open and high pressure in the pipe is difficult to form. The pressure dependence of the centrifugal pump makes it different from the rolling pump in operation. Its perfusion pressure is controlled by the speed. Because it is open, it is required to maintain a certain speed before the $ mathrm{CPB}$ starts and stops. The rolling pump cannot be used to gradually accelerate and decelerate, otherwise the peripheral resistance will be higher than the pump pressure and blood will flow back. During the perfusion process, the peripheral resistance changes continuously. Although the speed is the same, the flow will change accordingly, which requires the flow rate to be adjusted at any time. {Section 2 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation} {I. Principle} Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method of drawing blood from the body to the outside of the body, oxygenating it through the membrane lung, and then pumping the blood back into the body with a spring, which can provide long-term cardiopulmonary support. During ECMO treatment, the heart and lungs get enough rest, and the whole body oxygen supply and hemodynamics are in a relatively stable state. At this time, the membrane oxygenator can effectively remove carbon dioxide and take in oxygen, driving the spring to make blood flow in the body repeatedly. It buys precious time for the recovery of lung function and heart function. {I. The superiority of ECMO in respiratory and circulatory support} begin{enumerate} item It can support respiration and circulation for a long time (usually 3 to 8 days, and up to several weeks for the elderly), saving time for the recovery of cardiopulmonary function. Because the membrane oxygenator is designed based on the principle of bionics, the biocompatibility of the material and the improvement of CPB measures make the blood damage during oxygenation very light, extending the use time of ECMO. item Effectively improve hypoxemia. The oxygenator can oxygenate venous blood into arterial blood, with a flow rate of $1 sim 6 mathrm{~L}$ per minute, which can meet the oxygen needs of the body's tissue cells and discharge carbon dioxide. item Can avoid oxygen poisoning caused by long-term inhalation of high-concentration oxygen. Because the membrane oxygenator can achieve the oxygenation effect of normal lungs when giving air. item Avoid lung damage caused by mechanical ventilation. During ECMO treatment, the purpose of mechanical ventilation is to avoid lung collapse, and the requirements for airway pressure and lung expansion are not high. item Effective circulatory support. During ECMO treatment, right heart assist, left heart assist or full heart assist can be performed, and the heart preload can be reduced by adjusting venous return. In the absence or less positive inotropic drugs, the myocardium can get enough rest. end{enumerate} {Three, the difference between ECMO and CPB} The difference between ECMO and CPB is shown in Table 14-3. Table 14-3 The difference between ECMO and CPB begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} hline & CPB & ECMO hline Configuration & begin{tabular}{l} Traditional CPB machine:>3 pedals, pressure relief valve, heat exchange water tank end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Life support system: 1 pedal, centrifugal pump, constant temperature water tank end{tabular} hline Clamp & Open type, PVC & Closed type, surface coating hline Anticoagulation & Routine heparinization, ACT>400 seconds & Less or no use, ACT<200 seconds hline Time & 員, $1 sim 4$ hours & Long, 3 8 days or even weeks hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{center} begin{tabular}{lll} hline & multicolumn{1}{c}{CPB} & multicolumn{1}{c}{ECMO} hline Establishment of access & Open chest cardiac cannulation & Femoral or neck artery and vein Replacement & No need, disposable & Replace oxygenator or system components in time Purpose & For cardiac surgery or temporary assistance & Temporary support until cardiopulmonary function is restored & & Acceptance of heart and lung support or organ transplantation Cost & Low & High Personnel & $1 person$ & Team Success rate & High & Low Complications & Low & High Location & Operating room & ICU Temperature & Hypothermia & Normal temperature Blood release & Yes & No hline end{tabular} end{center} {IV.

The artery can be the femoral artery, ascending aorta or carotid artery. item Both respiratory and circulatory assistance can be provided. item Peripheral cannulation should be used as much as possible to reduce bleeding and infection. item See Table 14-4 for a comparison between V-A ECMO and V-V ECMO. end{enumerate} Table 14-4 Comparison of V-A ECMO and V-V ECMO begin{center} begin{tabular}{lll} hline & V-A ECMO & V-V ECMO hline Cardiac support & effective & ineffective Respiratory support & effective & effective Pulse waveform & weakened pulsatile blood flow & maintain pulsatile blood flow $ mathrm{CVP}$ & relatively low & accurate Pulmonary artery pressure & relatively low & accurate Pulmonary blood flow & reduced & normal Cerebral blood flow & can be reduced & can be increased $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ & accurate & relatively high $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ & $ geqslant 95 %$ & $80 % sim 95 %$ Blood recirculation & no & yes Intubation complications & more & less Cardiopulmonary embolism & easy to occur & not easy to occur hline end{tabular} end{center} {V. Clinical Application} {(I) Indications for ECMO} The effectiveness of ECMO treatment depends mainly on whether the heart and lung function structures can be restored, and the support effect on infants and young children with multiple organ failure is not good. begin{enumerate} item Reversible respiratory failure For patients with respiratory insufficiency caused by acute shock, aspiration, severe injury, infection, etc., ECMO can be considered. Neonatal congenital diaphragmatic hernia has a mortality rate of $50%$ in the first 24 hours due to severe restriction of alveolar expansion. Timely application of ECMO is likely to succeed. ECMO respiratory support indications are: (1) oxygenation dysfunction, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<50 mathrm{mmHg}$ or $ mathrm{D}_{( mathrm{Aax})} mathrm{O}_{2}>$ $620 mathrm{mmHg}$; (2) after acute lung injury, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<40 mathrm{mmHg}, mathrm{pH}<7.3$ for 2 hours; (3) after 3 hours of artificial respiration, $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<$ $55 mathrm{mmHg}$; (4.) airway pressure injury during artificial respiration. item ECMO circulatory support ECMO circulatory support is becoming more and more common. The application of ECMO to circulatory support in patients with severe heart failure has achieved good results, with a survival rate of up to $70%$. The key to ECMO treatment of acute heart failure is that heart function can be restored; the key to ECMO circulatory support after cardiac surgery is to exclude other heart malformations and ensure that the original malformations are corrected; myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is reversible. Careful examination and evaluation before ECMO treatment is very necessary. item ECMO can be used as a transitional means for patients who need heart and/or lung transplantation while waiting for a suitable donor. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Contraindications of ECMO} begin{enumerate} item Children with internal bleeding or bleeding signs may have aggravated bleeding because ECMO requires heparinization and consumption of coagulation factors. Once internal bleeding occurs, it is a serious threat to life, with a mortality rate of $94%$. item Mechanical ventilation alone for up to 7 days is a relative contraindication, and up to 10 days is an absolute contraindication. This is because long-term artificial respiration can lead to irreversible changes such as lung tissue fibrosis and severe lung damage. Although ECMO can effectively support the heart and lungs of children, it cannot cure irreversible damage to the lungs. item Children with severe congenital pulmonary hypoplasia and severe diaphragmatic hypoplasia are also difficult to correct their congenital hypoplasia with ECMO. A large amount of data shows that the combination of severe damage or deformity of other important organs other than the heart and lungs is closely related to death from ECMO. end{enumerate} {(III) Complications} The most common early complication of ECMO is bleeding, and cerebral hemorrhage is the most serious. The most common late complication is cerebral ischemia. In ECMO, coagulation function changes greatly, which is manifested in the application of heparin, the release of platelet active substances and the consumption of coagulation factors when the blood and foreign bodies come into contact with each other. Bleeding may occur inside the body, and severe coagulation may also occur. Long-term ECMO may also bring the risk of infection. {VI. Phase management of ECMO} {(I) Beginning phase} begin{enumerate} item ECMO requires adequate preparation and the organization of a capable medical team, including extracorporeal circulation physicians, anesthesiologists, ICU physicians, nursing staff, etc. The participation of surgeons is required for arteriovenous cannulation and cannulation. item Percutaneous puncture or arteriovenous cannulation can be performed in the ICU or operating room under anesthesia. First, prefill the membrane lung and the tube with heparinized saline; the tip of the arterial tube should reach the ideal position, and the tip of the venous tube should reach the atrial inlet of the inferior vena cava; the cannulation position can be confirmed by X-ray. If venous drainage is not smooth, other veins can be considered for relief. item In the first 15 minutes of ECMO, while maintaining a certain return chamber fluid level, the perfusion flow rate is increased as much as possible, which can quickly improve the body's hypoxia. After that, the flow rate is adjusted according to heart rate, blood pressure, CVP, etc., and the water, electrolyte and acid-base balance are maintained according to the results of blood gas analysis. After about 2 hours, the ECMO support phase begins. end{enumerate} {(II) Support phase} begin{enumerate} item The lungs and heart should be allowed to rest fully, and vasoactive drugs should be avoided as much as possible to give full play to the auxiliary role of the artificial heart and lungs. Mechanical ventilation in ECMO is very important. Usually, low-pressure and low-frequency breathing treatment is adopted, which can not only allow the lungs to rest, but also reduce the resistance of the lung end{enumerate} {Chapter 14 Extracorporeal Circulation and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation} blood vessels. Specific settings: Peak pressure is $20 sim 24 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, frequency is $10 sim 15$ times/min, $ mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is $21 % sim 50 %$ . begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Master the balance between oxygen supply and oxygen consumption. Oxygen supply reflects the oxygenation function of the membrane lung, and oxygen consumption reflects the aerobic metabolism of the tissue. In ECMO, oxygen consumption can be reduced due to temperature reduction, the use of anesthesia and muscle relaxants, and the resting state of the heart and lungs. It can also be increased due to muscle tremor, high catecholamines, high temperature, infection, etc. The ratio of oxygen supply to oxygen consumption is generally $4: 1$ . If arterial blood is fully oxygenated and the body's metabolism is normal, the mixed venous oxygen saturation should be $70 % sim 75 %$ . When oxygen supply is significantly reduced, oxygen consumption will also decrease, while anaerobic metabolism will increase and acidosis will occur. item Arterial blood gas should be checked every 2 hours within 8 hours of ECMO initiation, and once every 4 sim 8$ hours after the patient's condition stabilizes. $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ should be maintained at $80 sim 120 mathrm{mmHg}, and mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ should be maintained at $35 sim 45 mathrm{mmHg}$. item During ECMO, ACT should be maintained at $120 sim 200$ seconds; platelets should be maintained at (5～7) $ times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$; Hct should be around $35 %$. item In general, hemolysis during ECMO is mild. If hemolysis is severe and hemoglobinuria occurs, urine should be appropriately alkalized to promote the elimination of free hemoglobin and protect renal function. During ECMO, water and electrolyte balance should be maintained according to CVP, skin elasticity, etc. Water loss during ECMO cannot be ignored. At $37^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, the amount of water lost through the silicone membrane lung is $5 sim 10 mathrm{ml} / left( mathrm{m}^{2} cdot mathrm{h} right)$. Excessive water should be eliminated by the kidneys as much as possible using diuretics, or artificial kidneys can be used to filter water. During ECMO, blood pressure may be low, especially in the early stages of ECMO. The mean arterial pressure can be maintained at $50 sim 60 mathrm{mmHg}$. Keep body temperature at $35 sim 36^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. If the temperature is too high, the body's oxygen consumption will increase; if the temperature is too low, coagulation mechanism and hemodynamic disturbances are prone to occur. Keep the environment clean, disinfect the air regularly, and prevent infection. Because long-term heparinization and endotracheal intubation can increase oral and nasal bleeding or secretions, good care is required regularly. item Pay attention to energy supplementation. Energy consumption can be calculated through $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production. The average daily calorie supplement is $ mathrm{kcal} / mathrm{kg}$. item Long-term ECMO membrane lung may cause plasma leakage, poor gas exchange, and blockage. In severe cases, the membrane oxygenator should be replaced. end{enumerate} {11. Other precautions} (1) To maintain appropriate body temperature, a temperature-changing blanket should be placed on the mattress. (2) The patient should turn over regularly and appropriately to avoid the occurrence of pressure sores. (3) Select appropriate antibiotics according to clinical conditions. Pay attention to wound aseptic technique and change dressings in time to prevent infection complications. (4) Maintain urine volume $>1 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$; maintain colloidal osmotic pressure above $2.0 mathrm{kPa}(15 mathrm{mmHg})$. (5) For patients with prolonged support time, pay attention to supplementing fresh plasma, coagulation factors and platelets. (6) Use hemostatic drugs appropriately during surgery to reduce postoperative bleeding and blood transfusion. {(III) Termination phase} begin{enumerate} item As ECMO support is extended, the patient's lung function gradually recovers. When the circulation flow is only $10 % sim$ $25 %$ of the patient's blood flow and can maintain normal metabolism, ECMO termination can be considered. item After terminating ECMO for $1 sim$ 3$ hours, if the patient's condition is stable, the circulation tube can be removed. item After removing the circulation tube, repair the damaged blood vessels. item ECMO should be terminated in the following circumstances after 5-14 days of ECMO. end{enumerate} (1) Irreversible brain damage. (2) Severe failure of other important organs. (3) Intractable bleeding. (4) Irreversible damage to the heart and lungs. {Chapter 15 Hemodynamic Monitoring and Clinical Application} Hemodynamic monitoring is one of the important tasks in clinical anesthesia and ICU. It includes two parts: hemodynamic monitoring and hemodynamic regulation. Hemodynamic monitoring is divided into two categories: non-invasive and invasive. Hemodynamic regulation involves three aspects: cardiac preload, afterload and myocardial contractility. In theory, monitoring and regulation are two different parts, but in clinical practice, the two are inseparable. The purpose of monitoring is to correctly estimate the condition, make a clear diagnosis, guide treatment, provide a basis for regulation and accurately judge the effect of regulation; while the purpose of regulation is to maintain hemodynamic stability, and the effect of regulation is reflected in the changes in hemodynamic parameters. Together, the two provide guarantees for anesthesia surgery, postoperative recovery, and rescue of critically ill patients. Therefore, the monitoring of hemodynamics requires not only the familiarity and mastery of the methods, indications and clinical significance of hemodynamic monitoring, but also the continuous and dynamic monitoring of the effects of hemodynamic regulation, and the comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the changes in the cardiovascular system function, so as to correctly and timely analyze, judge and treat the condition. In recent years, continuity and non-invasiveness have been the development trend of hemodynamic monitoring. For example, ultrasound technology plays an increasingly important role in hemodynamic monitoring. Not only can it be operated and punctured under ultrasound guidance, but it can also be used to evaluate the patient's circulation status, blood volume and myocardial contractility through ultrasound examination, which has promoted the development of hemodynamic monitoring. {Section 1 Clinical Monitoring of Hemodynamics} {I. Arterial Pressure Monitoring} Arterial pressure refers to the lateral pressure of blood flow on the arterial wall. The blood filling and cardiac ejection in the circulatory system are the basic factors for the formation of blood pressure. Blood pressure is related to factors such as cardiac output, blood volume, peripheral vascular resistance, vascular elasticity and blood viscosity, and is an important indicator reflecting cardiac load, myocardial consumption and tissue perfusion. {(I) Measurement methods} Blood pressure monitoring is one of the most basic and important hemodynamic monitoring methods. Monitoring methods are divided into non-invasive, indirect pressure measurement and invasive, direct intra-arterial pressure measurement. begin{enumerate} item Non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring is an indirect pressure measurement method, which includes auscultatory pressure measurement and automatic non-invasive pressure measurement. Auscultatory pressure measurement uses the principle of Korotkoff sounds. The pressure corresponding to the first loud Korotkoff sound heard during the cuff deflation process is recorded as systolic pressure, and the pressure when the Korotkoff sound changes is recorded as diastolic pressure. This method is still the most standard blood pressure measurement method. Automatic non-invasive pressure measurement uses oscillation technology, with a pressure meter containing a pressure transducer, an automatic inflation spring and a microcomputer processing system, to measure blood pressure regularly and intermittently, and use data to display systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The monitor used in clinical practice uses this method to measure non-invasive blood pressure. end{enumerate} Non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring has the advantages of being non-invasive, easy to operate, widely applicable, and able to measure pressure on demand and on time, but it cannot quickly, in real time, and continuously display changes in arterial pressure. This method cannot meet clinical needs during the rescue of critically ill patients and major surgery, especially when blood pressure far exceeds the normal range due to severe contraction of peripheral blood vessels, insufficient blood volume, etc., and (or) blood pressure fluctuates rapidly and violently, it is difficult to accurately and timely measure arterial blood pressure. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Invasive direct arterial pressure measurement is a method of placing a catheter in a peripheral artery, connecting a pressure transducer, and continuously displaying the arterial pressure waveform and value on the display screen. The radial artery, brachial artery, dorsalis pedis artery, and femoral artery are commonly used puncture sites in clinical practice. Invasive direct arterial pressure measurement is mainly applicable to: (1) When continuous and real-time intraoperative arterial blood pressure monitoring is required, including: Surgeries with large fluctuations in hemodynamics, such as pheochromocytoma resection, etc.; Surgeries with large blood loss, such as giant meningioma resection, cavernous sinus fistula repair, aneurysm resection, etc.; Surgeries with special requirements, such as intraoperative fluid dilution and controlled hypotension, etc.; (2) Cardiac and large vessel surgery, surgery on critically ill patients, etc.; (3) Situations where real-time monitoring of systolic blood pressure and pulse variability is required to observe changes in patient volume, such as various types of shock, severe hypertension, heart failure, etc.; (4) When repeated arterial blood samples are required; (5) When arterial waveform monitoring is required; © When non-invasive pressure measurement fails. Direct arterial pressure measurement has the advantages of real-time, accurate, and continuous, and can directly display the arterial pressure waveform, which helps to evaluate the patient's circulatory status. It is of great significance for the hemodynamic monitoring of critically ill patients and patients undergoing major surgery. The complications of arterial puncture mainly include arterial embolism, limb ischemia, bleeding, hematoma, aneurysm formation, arteriovenous fistula, infection and peripheral nerve damage.\n",
      "{(II) Clinical significance} Arterial blood pressure is an important indicator of myocardial contractility and tissue perfusion. During anesthesia, the patient's internal environment and hemodynamics often fluctuate. Under normal circumstances, within a certain blood pressure range (MAP $50 sim 150 mathrm{mmHg}$), each organ can maintain a constant blood flow through an automatic regulation mechanism to meet tissue oxygen supply, so temporary hypotension within this range will not cause insufficient tissue blood supply. However, under anesthesia, this automatic regulation mechanism is weakened, and blood pressure fluctuations can easily cause insufficient tissue perfusion. Therefore, it is very important to routinely monitor blood pressure and maintain blood pressure within the normal range. It is generally believed that blood pressure should be measured at least every 5 minutes during ordinary surgery for adults, and the time interval or pressure measurement method should be adjusted according to the patient and the surgical situation. The systolic blood pressure range of a normal adult is $90 sim 140 mathrm{mmHg}$, and the diastolic blood pressure range is $60 sim 90 mathrm{mmHg}$. MAP is approximately equal to diastolic pressure plus $1/3$ pulse pressure. It depends on the blood flow through the blood vessels, namely cardiac output, and the elasticity and resistance of the blood vessels, namely peripheral vascular resistance, and reflects the average value of arterial blood pressure during a cardiac cycle. Arterial pressure varies with different arterial trunks. Usually, the systolic pressure of the femoral artery or radial artery is higher than that of the aorta or brachial artery, while the diastolic pressure of the peripheral artery is lower than that of the central artery, that is, the pulse pressure of the peripheral artery is greater than that of the aorta (Figure 15-1). begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-157} end{center} Figure 15-1 Arterial pressure difference at different parts When there is no aortic valve stenosis, systolic pressure reflects the maximum pressure of the left ventricle and can be used to monitor the left ventricular afterload. Diastolic pressure reflects the blood flow velocity and vascular elasticity in the artery, depends on the rate and time course of the diastolic pressure drop, and determines the perfusion pressure of the coronary artery. For critically ill patients, continuous monitoring of changes in arterial pressure waveforms can also be used to guide treatment and judge the efficacy. For patients with positive pressure ventilation (such as mechanical ventilation), the pulmonary veins are squeezed by lung expansion during inhalation, the amount of blood returning to the left ventricle increases, and the increased intrathoracic pressure causes the left ventricular afterload to decrease. The changes in the preload and afterload increase the left ventricular ejection volume, and the arterial pressure increases accordingly; at the same time, the increased intrathoracic pressure reduces the right heart return (right ventricular preload), and the lung expansion increases the pulmonary circulation resistance (right ventricular afterload), resulting in a decrease in right ventricular ejection volume. During exhalation, the left ventricular return (left ventricular preload) decreases due to the decrease in right ventricular ejection volume. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure increases the systemic circulation resistance, reduces the left ventricular ejection volume, and the arterial blood pressure decreases accordingly. This cyclical change of blood pressure with breathing is called systolic pressure variation (SPV). As a dynamic hemodynamic parameter, SPV can be measured through invasive arterial waveforms, and the normal value is $7 sim 10 mathrm{mmHg}$. Circulatory parameters that change cyclically due to changes in intrathoracic pressure and lung volume caused by breathing also include: pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) (see below for details). SPV, PPV and SVV are all dynamic parameters and have a high reference value in assessing volume load. If the patient's SPV exceeds the normal range, even if the arterial blood pressure is normal, there may still be insufficient volume. {2. Central venous pressure} Central venous pressure (CVP) refers to the pressure at the right atrium entrance of the superior and inferior vena cava located in the chest control, and is mainly used to reflect the preload of the right ventricle. {(I) Determination method} Clinically, the superior vena cava is often inserted through the right internal jugular vein or right subclavian vein. The left internal jugular vein and femoral vein can also be used. The CVP can be measured by connecting the central venous catheter inserted into the superior and inferior vena cava to the transducer. The inserted central venous catheter can not only measure CVP, but also serve as a large vein channel close to the heart. In emergency situations (such as severe blood loss), it can be used for rapid fluid replacement and infusion of various drugs (such as various types of intravenous nutrient solutions with low osmotic pressure, vasoactive drugs, electrolytes, chemotherapy drugs, etc.). Blood samples can also be collected through the central venous catheter for testing and analysis. Central venous catheterization is a commonly used monitoring and treatment method. Its main indications include: (1) critically ill patients with severe trauma and various types of shock; (2) patients who receive long-term infusion, total parenteral nutrition, or chemotherapy drugs; (3) various major surgeries or surgeries that may cause significant hemodynamic changes, such as cardiovascular and pheochromocytoma surgeries; (4) patients who need large amounts of blood transfusions and rapid fluid replacement; (5) patients who need to have a pacemaker or floating catheter placed through the central vein; (6) when peripheral venous access is difficult to establish; (7) when repeated intravenous blood sampling is required. Internal jugular vein and subclavian vein puncture should be performed with extreme caution in patients with severe coagulation disorders and hemothorax, and alternative puncture sites should be selected for patients with local skin infections. Improper central venous puncture and care can cause complications such as hematoma, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, hemothorax, hemothorax, air blockage, and infection. {(II) Clinical significance} The normal value of CVP is $5 sim 12 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, which depends on factors such as cardiac function, blood volume, venous vascular tension, intrapleural pressure, venous blood return and pulmonary circulation resistance, and can reflect the right ventricle's ability to discharge the amount of blood returning to the heart. Because CVP is equivalent to the right heart cavity pressure when the tricuspid braid is open during diastole, it is often used to estimate the right ventricular preload. Generally speaking, the assessment of preload can be carried out by measuring the ventricular filling pressure and then estimating the ventricular volume. The ventricular filling pressure is determined by the difference between the pressure in the large blood vessels and cardiac cavity and the pressure on the blood vessels and outside the heart (i.e., transmural pressure). Since CVP cannot represent transmural pressure, it cannot well reflect the preload of the right ventricle. Studies have shown that when blood volume changes significantly, CVP may only change slightly or basically not change. Therefore, a single CVP measurement or the absolute value of CVP cannot well reflect the circulation status. CVP is different from arterial pressure. The so-called normal value should not be emphasized, nor can it be used as the only indicator for evaluating blood volume and fluid therapy. Moreover, we should not force infusion to maintain the so-called normal value and cause infusion overload. If CVP is used to evaluate the body's blood volume and guide fluid therapy, it must be combined with other indicators such as blood pressure and urine volume, and the changing trend of this indicator should be dynamically observed to comprehensively judge the body's circulation status. Generally speaking, it is safe to supplement blood volume when CVP is not high or low. The relationship between cardiac output and CVP can be depicted as a cardiac function curve. Within a certain limit, cardiac output increases with the increase of CVP; beyond a certain limit, further increase in CVP can cause cardiac output to decrease or remain unchanged. The purpose of monitoring CVP is to provide appropriate filling pressure to ensure cardiac output. Since cardiac output cannot be measured routinely, in clinical practice, for patients with consistent left and right heart function and no heart valve disease or lung disease, the condition can be judged based on arterial pressure, pulse pressure, urine volume, clinical symptoms and signs, combined with changes in CVP to guide treatment (Table 15-1). Table 15-1 Causes and treatments for changes in central venous pressure begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} hline Central venous pressure & arterial pressure & principle & reason hline low & low & insufficient blood volume & supplement blood volume hline low & normal & good heart function, slightly insufficient blood volume & appropriate blood volume supplement hline high & low & poor heart function, reduced cardiac output & begin{tabular}{l} cardiotonic, blood supply, diuresis, correct acidosis, appropriately control fluid replacement or use vasodilators with caution end{tabular} hline isolated & normal & begin{tabular}{l} excessive vasoconstriction, increased pulmonary circulation resistance end{tabular} & use vasodilators to expand the volume vessels and pulmonary vessels hline normal & low & begin{tabular}{l} reduced heart function, excessive vasoconstriction =Contraction, insufficient or normal blood flow end{tabular} & Cardiotonic, fluid replacement test, appropriate fluid replacement when volume is insufficient hline end{tabular} end{center} {III. Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure} Pulmonary artery pressure refers to the lateral pressure of blood flow on the pulmonary artery wall, including pulmonary artery systolic pressure (pulmonary artery systolic pressure, PASP), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, PADP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mean pulmonary artery pressure, MPAP). {(I) Measurement method} The pulmonary artery floating catheter (Swan-Ganz catheter, Figure 15-2) is placed into the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava through the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein or femoral vein, and then into the right atrium. The distal end of the catheter is inflated with air, and the blood flow during heart beat is used to push the distal end of the catheter to float through the right ventricle, enter the pulmonary artery trunk, and reach the pulmonary arteriole. When the distal end of the floating catheter is located behind the pulmonary arteriole and the distal end of the catheter is not inflated, the distal end of the catheter measures the pulmonary artery pressure. After the distal end of the catheter is inflated, the forward blood flow in the pulmonary arteriole is blocked, and the pressure measured at this time is the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). PAWP reflects the pressure of the pulmonary venous system and the left atrium beyond. Since the pulmonary venous pressure is only $1 sim 2 mathrm{mmHg}$ higher than the left atrial pressure (left atrium pressure, LAP), and LAP can reflect the left ventricular diastolic pressure when the mitral valve is open during diastole, PAWP can indirectly reflect the left ventricular preload. The continuous pressure change curve recorded during the placement of the floating catheter and the relationship between the pulmonary artery wedge pressure and the pulmonary artery pressure are shown in Figure 15-2. includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-159} Figure 15-2 Pressure waveform changes during floating catheter placement In recent years, pulmonary artery catheters have been continuously improved and their uses have increased. Floating catheters containing optical fibers can continuously measure mixed venous oxygen saturation $left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$, which can reflect the balance of systemic oxygen supply/consumption; floating catheters with fast-response thermistors can measure right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF); adding a thermoelectric heating wire $14 sim 25 mathrm{~cm}$ from the top of the pulmonary artery catheter can continuously monitor cardiac output through blood thermodilution; if an ultrasound probe is installed on the floating catheter, pulmonary artery blood flow can also be continuously measured. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is a complex, expensive, invasive examination with high risks. Common complications of pulmonary artery catheter placement and monitoring include: arrhythmia, catheter twisting, kinking, breaking, thrombosis, pulmonary obstruction, pulmonary artery rupture, bleeding and infection. In 2003, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published the latest guidelines for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. The guidelines point out that the patient's condition, the degree of surgical risk and supporting facilities should be considered comprehensively, and the examination should be performed only after it is determined that the patient can benefit from it. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring can be considered in the following cases: begin{enumerate} item Patients facing obvious hemodynamic instability, such as severe heart disease, severe pulmonary insufficiency, renal insufficiency; patients with other factors that may cause hemodynamic instability, such as advanced age, endocrine system disorders, sepsis, trauma, burns, etc. item ASA IV-V patients with hemodynamic disorders that may lead to organ dysfunction. item High-risk surgical patients who may cause major fluid loss, hemodynamic disorders, and may cause damage to important organ functions. This examination is not necessary for low- and medium-risk surgeries with little fluid loss, no serious hemodynamic disturbances, and no high mortality rate. When deciding to implement this monitoring, the operator's proficiency, supporting instruments and equipment, catheter care, and treatment of complications should also be fully evaluated to ensure that the patient's benefits from this examination outweigh the risks. end{enumerate} There are no absolute contraindications for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. It is generally not suitable for cases such as tricuspid or pulmonary artery stenosis, right atrial or right ventricular tumors, and tetralogy of Fallot. Severe arrhythmias, coagulation disorders, and recent placement of pacing catheters are often relative contraindications. The choice can be made based on the needs of the disease and the operator's familiarity, weighing the pros and cons.\n",
      "{(II) Clinical significance} Pulmonary artery pressure is only about $1/5$ of aortic pressure and is an important indicator of right ventricular afterload. Its normal values ​​are: systolic pressure $15 sim 28 mathrm{mmHg}$, diastolic pressure $8 sim 15 mathrm{mmHg}$, and mean pressure $10 sim 25 mathrm{mmHg}$. Pulmonary hypertension can be diagnosed when the mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds $25 mathrm{mmHg}$ at rest or exceeds $30 mathrm{mmHg}$ after activity. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) depends on right ventricular function, ejection rate and pulmonary artery elasticity; pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP) depends on the duration of right ventricular diastole and pulmonary artery resistance. When the mitral valve functions normally, PAWP is only $1 sim 2 mathrm{mmHg}$ higher than LAP, which can more accurately reflect pulmonary venous pressure and LAP, and can therefore be used to evaluate pulmonary circulation resistance and left ventricular preload. If there is no lesion in the pulmonary vessels, PADP is only $1 sim 3 mathrm{mmHg}$ higher than PAWP, so PADP can reflect the PAWP level, and then reflect LAP and left ventricular preload. Moreover, PADP can be measured continuously, which is more convenient than PAWP. PAWP helps to distinguish cardiogenic pulmonary edema from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. When the patient has left ventricular dysfunction, CVP cannot reflect the function of the left ventricle, while PAWP can reflect the left atrial pressure and can indirectly reflect the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Common causes of elevated PCWP are left heart failure or excessive infusion. When PAWP $>18 mathrm{mmHg}$, pulmonary congestion may occur, and when PAWP $>25 mathrm{mmHg}$, the possibility of pulmonary edema increases significantly. For critically ill patients with unstable circulation and heart failure, PAWP and cardiac output can be monitored simultaneously through Swan-Ganz catheters to draw a left ventricular function curve. Analysis, judgment and treatment can be carried out according to the position of the cardiac function curve, and the plan can be adjusted in time according to the trend of changes in the cardiac function curve after treatment, so as to further guide the application of volume therapy, positive inotropic drugs and vasoactive drugs (Figure 15-3). {IV. Cardiac output} Cardiac output (CO) refers to the amount of blood ejected by the heart per unit time. It is an important indicator reflecting cardiac function and is affected by factors such as heart rate (HR), myocardial contractility, preload and afterload. {$(I)$ Measurement method} CO measurement methods can be divided into two categories: invasive and non-invasive. Non-invasive CO measurement includes cardiopulmonary bypass blood flow graph, echocardiography, Doppler technology and carbon dioxide non-invasive CO measurement. Invasive CO measurement includes Fick oxygen consumption method, indicator dilution method and thermal dilution method. Among them, bedside CO measurement using Swan-Ganz thermal dilution floating catheter is safe, simple and accurate, and is still the most commonly used method in clinical practice. $10 ml of normal saline or $5%$ glucose solution ($5 ml for children) at air temperature $left(25^{circ} mathrm{C} right)$ or cold $left(0 sim 5^{circ} mathrm{C} right)$ is rapidly injected into the tube opening in the right atrium $30 ml for children $15 ml for children) from the tip of the floating catheter. The injected solution is immediately released by the blood and the temperature rises accordingly. The thermocouple at $4 cm away from the tip of the catheter continuously measures the temperature change and the $mathrm{CO}$ is calculated based on the humidity-time curve. Generally, three measurements are required and the average value is taken. The cardiac index ( $mathrm{Cl}$ ) can be obtained by dividing $mathrm{CO}$ by the body surface area. CO divided by heart rate can be used to obtain stroke volume (SV). In recent years, the new generation of pulmonary artery catheters have a built-in heating wire about $15 sim 25 mathrm{~cm}$ from the end. By periodically heating the blood flowing through the pulmonary artery, the temperature-village curve can be continuously obtained to measure cardiac output. In addition, begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-161} end{center} Figure 15-3 Schematic diagram of floating catheter and pressure measurement device The new generation of Swan-Ganz catheters can also measure mixed venous oxygen saturation $left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$ while continuously monitoring CO and changes in circulatory function, which helps to understand the balance of oxygen supply and demand throughout the body. In addition, the CVP, PASP, PADP, PAWP and other indicators measured by the pulmonary artery catheter can provide a good comprehensive assessment of the body's hemodynamics. With the development of medical technology, the pulse indicator continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring system that can continuously monitor CO is also used in clinical practice. This monitoring system combines the transpulmonary thermodilution method with the arterial pulse contour analysis technology. It can not only measure $ mathrm{CO}$ through the transpulmonary thermodilution method, but also continuously monitor indicators such as pulse contour cardiac output (PCCO). Compared with the classic thermodilution method for CO measurement, the PiCCO system does not require a pulmonary artery catheter, but only requires a peripheral arterial catheter and a central venous catheter. The transpulmonary thermodilution method is to inject ice saline $ left(0 sim 4^{ circ} mathrm{C} right.$ ) through the central vein, and then measure the temperature change through the thermistor built into the catheter of the peripheral large arteries (femoral artery, axillary artery, brachial artery), and then measure $ mathrm{CO}$ . Afterwards, $ mathrm{CI}$ , intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), global end diastolic volume (GEDV), extravascular lung water (EVLW}$ ), pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) and other parameters can be further calculated based on $ mathrm{CO}$ . After the arterial pulse contour method is corrected by the transpulmonary thermodilution method, important parameters such as PCCO, HR, SV, MAP, SVV, PPV, peripheral vascular resistance index (systemic vascular resistance index, SVRI), and left ventricular contractility index (dPmax) can be continuously monitored. Studies have shown that the CO measured by the transpulmonary thermodilution method is well correlated with the CO measured by the classical thermodilution method. Because the system has the characteristics of real-time, continuous, dynamic monitoring and simpler operation, and can simultaneously evaluate the preload, afterload and myocardial contractility, it is currently widely used in clinical practice. The Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter is still the classic method for measuring CO, and it can also directly measure pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and mixed venous oxygen saturation, the latter of which is an important indicator of systemic oxygen supply and demand balance. Therefore, the pulmonary artery pressure measurement system still plays an irreplaceable role in hemodynamic monitoring. {(II) Clinical significance} begin{enumerate} item Monitoring cardiac function The complete function of the cardiovascular system is ultimately reflected in the amount of CO. In a resting state, the CO of a healthy adult male is $5 sim 6 L/min, the SV is about $70 ml, and the CI is $3.0 sim 3.5 L/left (min cdot m^2)$, which changes with different physiological needs. During strenuous exercise, CO can increase by $4 sim 7$ times under complex neural and fluid regulation. Therefore, it is very important to monitor CO changes and understand the function of the heart. There are many factors that affect CO clinically. In addition to the synergistic effects of all units of the cardiovascular system (venous system, right heart, pulmonary vascular system, left heart, arterial system and blood), it mainly depends on $HR$ (rate and rhythm) and SV (preload, myocardial contractility and afterload). Monitoring CO can not only conduct a comprehensive and dynamic analysis and judgment of changes in cardiac function, but also guide the application of infusion and vasoactive drugs according to the cardiac function curve. Item Calculation of hemodynamic parameters Combined with other indicators, CO can be used to calculate CI, SV, SVI, SVV, PPV, SVR, PVR, GEDV, EVLW and other parameters. PPV, SVV and SPV are both circulatory index variation parameters caused by breathing. The normal value of PPV is less than $13%$, and the normal value of SVV is no more than $10%$. When the normal value is exceeded, it indicates insufficient volume load. GEDV is a volume load index calculated by the pulmonary thermodilution method. Studies have shown that GEDV has a better correlation with SV than pressure load indicators such as CVP and PAWP, which are also static parameters, and is more suitable for guiding fluid therapy. Another volume load index EVLW can be used to judge cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and has become an independent risk factor for critically ill patients and has received more and more attention. item Determine the balance of tissue oxygen supply and demand By monitoring hemoglobin concentration, cardiac output, arterial oxygen saturation, and mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$, oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$ and oxygen consumption $ left( mathrm{VO}_{2} right)$ can be calculated respectively to understand tissue perfusion, oxygenation, and metabolic status, guide clinical treatment, and evaluate efficacy. $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ does not reflect the oxygenation status of local organs, but is a comprehensive indicator used to measure the balance of oxygen supply and demand in the body. $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ not only reflects the oxygenation function of the respiratory system, but also reflects changes in circulatory function and metabolism; the normal value range is $70% sim 75%$, and the corresponding $ mathrm{PvO}_{2}$ is $35 sim 40 mathrm{mmHg}$. $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ less than $60%$ reflects that the whole body tissue oxygenation is threatened, less than $50%$ indicates severe tissue hypoxia, greater than $80%$ indicates insufficient oxygen utilization, and greater than $90%$ indicates a significant increase in tissue shunt. $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is affected by $ mathrm{CO}, mathrm{Hb}, mathrm{SaO}_{2}$, and $ mathrm{VO}_{2}$. Since the ultimate goal of monitoring hemodynamics is to maintain the balance of oxygen supply and demand in the body, $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is a very important indicator in hemodynamic monitoring. end{enumerate} {V. Peripheral vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance} The resistance faced by cardiac ejection is afterload. The left ventricular afterload is represented by peripheral vascular resistance (systemic vascular resistance, SVR), and the right ventricular afterload is represented by pulmonary vascular resistance (pulmonary vascular resistance, PVR). Clinically, peripheral vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance are not directly measured by monitoring, but calculated from direct measurement indicators. {(I) Peripheral vascular resistance} SVR refers to the resistance of small arteries and arterioles to blood flow, and the calculation formula is $SVR=80$ (MAP-RAP) $/CO$, where RAP is the right atrial pressure, which can be replaced by CVP when measurement is difficult. The normal value of SVR is $900 sim 1400(mathrm{dyn} cdot mathrm{s}) / mathrm{cm}^{5}$. After standardizing SVR, the peripheral vascular resistance index (systemic vascular resistance index, SVRI) can be calculated, SVRI $=80$ (MAP-RAP)/ $mathrm{CI}$, and the normal value is $1700 sim 2600(mathrm{dyn} cdot mathrm{s}) / mathrm{cm}^{5}$. In heart failure and cardiogenic shock, the tension of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system increases to maintain a certain perfusion pressure, at which time SVR increases significantly.\n",
      "{(II) Pulmonary vascular resistance} PVR is an important indicator reflecting the state of pulmonary circulation. The calculation formula is PVR $=80$ (MPAP-LAP)/CO. PAWP can be used instead when LAP is difficult to measure. The normal value of PVR is $20 sim 130( mathrm{dyn} cdot mathrm{s}) / mathrm{cm}^{5}$. The calculation formula of pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) is PVRI $=80$ (MPAP-LAP) $/ mathrm{CI}$, and the normal value is $70 sim 180( mathrm{dyn} cdot mathrm{s}) /$ $ mathrm{cm}^{5}$. An increase in PVR may be due to reversible abnormalities, such as heart failure or hypoxemia; it may also be due to irreversible anatomical changes, such as primary pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease with severe left-to-right shunt. It is necessary to determine whether the elevated PVR can be reduced quickly so that the correct treatment plan can be formulated clinically. {VI. Application of Ultrasound Technology in Hemodynamic Monitoring} Ultrasound technology is to transmit ultrasound waves into the human body through an ultrasound probe. Ultrasound waves may be absorbed and attenuated by tissues in the body, and reflection and refraction may occur when encountering different tissue interfaces. Because the reflection and refraction of different tissues and the degree of absorption of ultrasound waves are different, the returned sound waves can be displayed as different waveforms, curves or images after being received by the probe and processed by the instrument. This overcomes the limitation of visual perspective to a certain extent and becomes the basis for ultrasound diagnosis and guidance of operation and treatment. In recent years, ultrasound technology has been widely used in hemodynamic monitoring due to its advantages of non-invasive, continuous, accurate, real-time and convenient. begin{enumerate} item Application of Ultrasound Technology in Arterial and Venous Puncture Catheterization Arterial puncture can not only be performed after palpating the arterial pulsation, but also can be performed in real time under ultrasound guidance. After mastering it, the success rate can be greatly improved and the puncture injury can be minimized. In some special cases (such as patients with weak peripheral arterial pulsations, or difficult to palpate or blind puncture failure), it has great advantages. end{enumerate} During central venous puncture, serious complications such as pneumothorax and hemothorax may be caused by damage to surrounding important structures (arteries, lung apex, etc.). After the introduction of ultrasound technology, blood vessels and surrounding structures can be clearly displayed under ultrasound. Using ultrasound positioning or puncture under ultrasound guidance can minimize damage caused by improper puncture, reduce complications, greatly improve the success rate and safety of puncture, and significantly shorten the puncture time after mastering it. For patients with vascular variations and combined conditions that are not suitable for puncture (such as vascular embolism, etc.), the application of ultrasound technology is even more necessary. At present, the application of ultrasound technology in central venous puncture has gradually received more and more attention from clinical physicians. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Echocardiography for hemodynamic assessment Echocardiography (echocardiography) is used for examination of the heart and great vessels and for hemodynamic assessment. It can be divided into transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). During TEE examination, the ultrasound probe in the esophagus is located behind the heart. Its position close to the heart allows it to obtain clearer and higher-quality images than TTE, especially the structures on the back of the heart (such as the left atrial appendage, pulmonary veins, etc.). In clinical anesthesia, TEE is more widely used. end{enumerate} $ mathrm{TEE}$ It can not only clearly display the structure of the heart and great vessels, but also monitor cardiac output, ventricular contraction and relaxation in real time, assess ventricular preload and afterload status, cardiac ejection and filling conditions, and can sensitively detect myocardial ischemia. TEE measures the blood flow velocity and the cross-sectional area of ​​the descending aorta and calculates the product of the two to obtain cardiac output. Ventricular systolic function is assessed by measuring the end diastolic volume (EDV) and the end systolic volume (ESV) and calculating the fraction area change (FAR, FAR = (EDV-ESV)/EDV); ventricular diastolic function is assessed by observing the blood flow across the valve; TEE is used to observe segmental wall motion abnormalities, which can detect myocardial ischemia early. Studies have shown that TEE can detect myocardial ischemia earlier than electrocardiogram. TEE examination has the advantages of being non-invasive, rapid, continuous, and real-time. Its ability to quickly evaluate greatly exceeds that of invasive monitoring, and it has occupied a very important position in hemodynamic monitoring. Especially for patients with unstable circulation, it can quickly provide indicators such as preload, afterload and myocardial contractility before establishing invasive monitoring, effectively guide clinical treatment, and reflect the treatment results in time. It can be predicted that ultrasound technology will play a greater role in the field of hemodynamic monitoring in the future. Although TEE is a non-invasive examination, relatively safe and widely applicable, its use also has contraindications. Absolute contraindications include: patient refusal, unstable cervical spine (such as cervical fracture, dislocation, etc.) and various conditions that may cause esophageal or gastric wall perforation (such as esophageal stenosis, tumor, trauma, fistula, ventricle, etc.). Relative contraindications include: abnormal coagulation function, huge diaphragmatic hernia, esophageal varices and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Liu Jin Yu Jie) {Section 2 Hemodynamic Regulation} The purpose of hemodynamic monitoring is to evaluate cardiovascular function, hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion by timely and accurately monitoring the changes in hemodynamic index parameters, and to carry out hemodynamic regulation and treatment accordingly, so as to ensure the perfusion of tissues and organs. Insufficient perfusion of tissues and organs will lead to ischemia and hypoxia, temporary or permanent organ dysfunction. If insufficient perfusion of tissues and organs is not corrected in time, it can lead to dysfunction and failure of multiple organs in the whole body, and even death of the patient. Therefore, maintaining stable perioperative hemodynamics and appropriate tissue perfusion is crucial to ensure patient safety and improve patient prognosis. The main factors that cause hemodynamic changes in clinical practice include preload, myocardial contractility and afterload. Therefore, the key to maintaining stable hemodynamics is to maintain appropriate venous return and effective circulating blood volume, maintain good cardiac function and maintain appropriate vascular tension. When adjusting hemodynamics, in addition to continuously and dynamically monitoring indicators such as arterial pressure, central venous pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, it is still necessary to combine the patient's own signs and response to treatment, such as heart rate, skin color and temperature, urine and peripheral circulation, and accurately evaluate and analyze hemodynamics according to the trend and evolution of these changes, and adopt targeted treatment plans. {I. Adjustment of preload} Appropriate preload should help the heart to perform its compensatory function, while not reducing myocardial contractility and increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. The state of cardiac preload is mainly determined by the patient's blood and fluid loss, as well as the changing trends of $ mathrm{HR} , mathrm{BP}$ , CVP, and PAWP before and after blood transfusion and fluid replacement. If conditions permit, TTE or TEE can be used to determine the preload state by the filling degree of the vena cava and its variation during breathing, as well as the filling degree of the heart control, combined with indicators such as ejection fraction. {I. Treatment of low preload} begin{enumerate} item Adjust body position Lowering the head or raising the lower limbs when the patient is lying flat can immediately increase the amount of blood returning to the heart and preload. item Replenish effective blood volume According to the blood loss, fluid loss, the trend of CVP and PAWP, and the assessment of blood volume by ultrasound, when the effective circulating blood volume is insufficient, blood products such as plasma and albumin, or colloid fluids (such as gelatin preparations, low molecular weight dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, etc.), or crystalloid fluids (such as sodium lactate Ringer's injection, saline, etc.) can be transfused. During the fluid replacement process, the disturbance of acid-base and water-electrolyte balance caused by blood loss, fluid loss and large-scale fluid replacement should be considered. item Regulate intrathoracic pressure For patients undergoing positive pressure ventilation, appropriately reducing ventilation pressure and PEEP can increase preload. item Relieve acute venous return obstruction For example, when pregnant women lie on their backs, the compression of the uterus and fetus on the vena cava can affect venous return. Moderate left lateral decubitus or slightly pushing the uterus to the left when lying on the back can relieve the obstruction of the inferior vena cava return. end{enumerate} {(II) Treatment of excessive preload} begin{enumerate} item Adjust body position Semi-recumbent or sitting position with legs hanging down can immediately reduce venous return and preload. item Diuretics Reduce preload, relieve pulmonary congestion and improve ventricular function by inhibiting renal water and sodium reabsorption. The use of diuretics may cause new water and electrolyte disturbances. For example, after a patient uses diuretics, potassium is excreted in large quantities with urine, which may cause hypokalemia. item Vasodilators Vasodilators can reduce cardiac preload, reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and improve ventricular function by dilating capacitance vessels. Nitroglycerin is the most commonly used in clinical practice. Its effect of dilating veins is stronger than that of dilating arterioles, and its effect of reducing preload is obvious. In case of heart failure with high volume load, nitroglycerin is the first choice. The initial dose of intravenous infusion is $0.5 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, which is then adjusted according to CVP, PAWP and arterial blood pressure. The maximum dose in the short term can reach $10 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min}). $ item Adjustment of intrathoracic pressure During mechanical ventilation, increasing intrathoracic pressure by increasing ventilation pressure or PEEP can also reduce the amount of blood returning to the heart and reduce preload, but it is necessary to be vigilant that excessive obstruction of venous return will inevitably cause peripheral venous congestion. item Ultrafiltration During extracorporeal circulation, ultrafiltration or ordinary ultrafiltration can remove excess water and some small molecules in the blood vessels. Acute left heart failure with excessive preload is one of the indications for emergency ultrafiltration. During extracorporeal circulation, the amount of blood returning to the heart and the preload can also be reduced by controlling the venous return line. item Others Changes in preload caused by arrhythmia, cardiac tamponade, mitral stenosis, ventricular wall hypertrophy and decreased compliance require appropriate treatment. end{enumerate} {II. Regulation of afterload} Appropriate afterload helps maintain blood pressure and perfusion of important organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, and does not overload the heart, increase myocardial work and oxygen consumption. Cardiac afterload mainly depends on peripheral vascular resistance, and its status can be assessed by mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output $(C O)$. Regulation of afterload requires vasoactive drugs, which should be administered through large blood vessels such as central veins as much as possible when used (especially strong vasoconstrictors), and avoid drug leakage into the subcutaneous tissue to cause skin ischemia and necrosis. {(I) Regulation of excessive afterload} Mainly the use of vasodilators. begin{enumerate} item Sodium nitroprusside has a stronger effect in dilating arterioles than in dilating veins, so it has a stronger effect in reducing afterload. Sodium nitrate is the first choice for patients with heart failure and high afterload (high blood pressure and low cardiac output). The initial dose for intravenous injection is $0.1 mu mathrm{g}/( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, which can be adjusted according to arterial blood pressure and patient response. The maximum dose can reach $10 mu mathrm{g}/( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. Long-term or long-term use of nitrate end{enumerate}\n",
      "{Chapter 15 Hemodynamic Monitoring and Clinical Application} Sodium should be alert to nitrogen poisoning. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Calcium channel blockers can dilate arteries (including coronary arteries), reduce vascular resistance, inhibit myocardial contraction, and inhibit atrioventricular conduction. Nicardipine, nifedipine, felodipine, nimodipine, etc. are dihydropyridine phosphodiesterase channel blockers, which can dilate arteriolar smooth muscle and reduce afterload. Diltiazem, verapamil, etc. are non-dihydropyridine phosphodiesterase channel blockers, which are suitable for hemodynamically stable narrow $Q R S$ supraventricular tachycardia. The usual intravenous infusion dose of nicardipine is $1 sim 10 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. Nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, etc. are usually taken orally, with a slow onset of action, and are generally used as long-term medications for the treatment of hypertension. item $ alpha_{1}$ receptor antagonists $ alpha_{1}$ receptors are distributed in vascular smooth muscle and pupil dilator muscle. $ alpha_{1}$ receptor antagonists such as phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine can dilate blood vessels and are mainly used for preoperative preparation of patients with pheochromocytoma and treatment of intraoperative hypertensive crisis. Ganglion blocking drugs and purine derivatives have many side effects and are limited in acute hemodynamic regulation. item Prostaglandins $E_{1}$, sildenafil and nitric oxide (NO) are relatively selective pulmonary vasodilators and are often used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Generally, they start with a small dose and gradually increase the dose to a satisfactory therapeutic effect or the maximum clinical dose. Since NO can be quickly ineffective by binding to hemoglobin, inhaled NO can selectively dilate the pulmonary blood vessels in the ventilation area. In recent years, it has been widely used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction. The commonly used inhaled concentration in clinical practice is $5 sim 20 mathrm{ppm}$. end{enumerate} {(II) Adjustment of low afterload} Consider using vasoconstrictors. Maintaining proper vascular resistance is very important for hemodynamic stability. When using vasoconstrictors, it is necessary to first ensure that the myocardium has sufficient contractile capacity, while trying to maintain proper preload. It should also be considered that the increase in afterload usually increases cardiac work and myocardial oxygen consumption. If necessary, positive inotropes can be used in combination. When patients with septic shock are insensitive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, glucocorticoids should be considered, with hydrocortisone being the first choice. begin{enumerate} item Norepinephrine produces a strong vasoconstrictive effect (dilation of the coronary arteries) by stimulating $ alpha$ receptors, increasing afterload. In the treatment of septic shock, norepinephrine can be used as a first-line drug. While volume therapy is being given, it can maintain proper vascular resistance, increase blood pressure, and improve perfusion. Norepinephrine has a short half-life and requires continuous infusion to maintain efficacy. The commonly used dose is $0.03 sim 1.5 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. Doses exceeding $1.0 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ can increase myocardial work and oxygen consumption due to enhanced excitation of $ beta$ receptors. In septic shock, the level of vasopressin in the blood is significantly lower than normal, so vasopressin can be considered when catecholamines such as norepinephrine are ineffective; but it must be used in small doses of $(0.01 sim 0.04 mathrm{U} / mathrm{min})$. Large doses can cause strong contraction of visceral blood vessels including coronary arteries, thereby aggravating visceral organ ischemia. item Phenylephrine Produces vasoconstriction by stimulating $ alpha$ receptors. Compared with norepinephrine, the effect of phenylephrine is weaker and more persistent. The usual dose is $0.2 mg intravenously at a concentration of $0.01 %$, administered every $10 sim 15$ minutes as needed. item Metahydroxylamine produces vasoconstriction by stimulating $alpha$ receptors, and can indirectly promote the release of norepinephrine. The vasoconstriction effect is weaker than that of norepinephrine, and the duration of action is shorter than that of phenylephrine. The usual dose is $0.2 sim 0.5 mg intravenously at a concentration of $0.01 %$. Repeated administration in a short period of time can lead to rapid tolerance. end{enumerate} {III. Regulation of myocardial contractility} Appropriate myocardial contractility is the basis for maintaining cardiac function. In addition to indirectly reflecting myocardial contractility through heart rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure, and fluid infusion test, myocardial contractility can also be qualitatively or quantitatively evaluated through real-time monitoring of surface or transesophageal echocardiography, and myocardial contractility can be continuously adjusted in real time under continuous monitoring of ultrasound. Under the condition of ensuring appropriate preload and afterload, the use of positive inotropic drugs should be considered for low cardiac output caused by poor myocardial contractility. {(I) Application of positive inotropic drugs (refer to the 2010 edition of the Chinese National Prescription Collection)} begin{enumerate} item Digitalis Digitalis drugs inhibit the $ mathrm{Na}^{+}- mathrm{K}^{+}- mathrm{ATP}$ enzyme in the myocardial cell membrane, increase the $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in myocardial cells, and increase myocardial contractility. Digitalis is still widely used in the treatment of chronic heart failure; however, due to its slow onset, long elimination time, poor controllability, and easy poisoning, its use in acute heart failure (especially during surgery) is greatly limited. For rapid atrial fibrillation combined with congestive heart failure, the first choice is to slowly inject lanolin intravenously. For adults, dilute it with 20 ml of 5% glucose injection and then slowly inject it intravenously. For patients who have not used digitalis glycosides within 2 weeks or have not used digoxin within 1 week, the initial dose is 0.4-0.6 mg, and then 0.2-0.4 mg can be given every 2-4 hours. The total dose in 24 hours should not exceed 1-1.6 mg. Oral digoxin is often used to treat chronic heart failure. Before using digitalis, attention should be paid to blood potassium and be alert to digitalis poisoning. end{enumerate} {2. Sympathomimetic amines} (1) Epinephrine: It does not have $ alpha, beta$ receptor stimulating effects. It increases heart rate and myocardial contractility by stimulating $ beta_{1}$ receptors. In adults, when $1 sim 2 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{min}$ is given, it mainly acts on $ beta$ receptors, $2 sim 10 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{min}$ has both $ alpha and beta$ receptor effects, and $10 sim 20 mu mathrm{g} /$ $ min$ has mainly $ alpha$ receptor effects. Epinephrine is a strong and short-acting positive inotropic drug. In adults with acute left heart failure, a single dose of $2 sim 8 mu mathrm{g}$ can produce a strong cardiac excitatory effect that lasts for 1 to 5 minutes. It is now advocated that it should be continuously infused through a central vein with a micro-volume under continuous monitoring, $0.03 sim 0.1 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ can be used when other sympathomimetic amine positive inotropic drugs are ineffective. Adverse reactions are tachycardia, arrhythmia and peripheral tissue hypoperfusion caused by sustained peripheral vasoconstriction. It is often used in combination with vasodilators to improve peripheral tissue hypoperfusion. In addition to stimulating $ beta_{1}$ receptors, adrenaline purple also has stimulatory effects on $ alpha$ receptors and $ beta_{2}$ receptors, which can contract peripheral blood vessels, increase peripheral resistance, relax bronchial smooth muscle, and improve ventilation. It is the first choice for anaphylactic shock. When it is difficult to establish an intravenous channel, it can be injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly, and the dosage is $0.5 sim 1 mathrm{mg}$ each time. (2) Dobutamine: Increases myocardial contractility by stimulating myocardial $ beta_{1}$ receptors; the effect of stimulating $ alpha$ receptors is weaker, and the vasoconstriction caused by the stimulation of peripheral $ alpha_{1}$ receptors and the vasodilation caused by the stimulation of $ beta$ 2 receptors work together to show a weak vasodilation effect. It is often used for acute heart failure after cardiac surgery and acute myocardial infarction, and acute deterioration of chronic congestive heart failure. Dobutamine is more effective than dopamine in increasing myocardial contractility, reducing peripheral resistance and wall tension, but has a weaker effect on increasing heart rate. (3) Dopamine: It can stimulate $ alpha_{1}, beta_{1}$ receptors and dopamine receptors. The effect on receptors is dose-dependent. It starts to act on dopamine receptors at $0.5 sim 1.0 mu mathrm{g} /$ ( $ mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, and has the strongest effect at 2 $ sim 3 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. It can stimulate dopamine receptors in the kidneys and other visceral blood vessels, increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, but does not have a kidney-protective effect (2008 Guidelines for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock); at 2 $ sim mu mu /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, it has a significant effect on the $ beta_{1}$ receptors of the heart, increasing heart rate and myocardial contractility; when the dose is greater than $5 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, it has a significant effect on the peripheral $ alpha$ receptors, manifesting as vasoconstriction and increased peripheral resistance. Therefore, dopamine is generally used in patients with acute heart failure who need both cardiotonic and vasoconstrictive effects, or in combination with vasodilators in other patients with heart failure. When dopamine is used in small doses, the vasodilation effect after dopamine receptor stimulation can be used to overcome the vasoconstrictive effect of other sympathomimetic amines. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitors PDE-II inhibitors can be divided into bipyridines (amrinone and milrinone) and imidazoles (enoxaparin). The mechanism by which they produce different effects on myocardium and smooth muscle is that cAMP activates myocardial calcium channels, promoting influx of calcium during contraction; while cAMP does not activate smooth muscle calcium channels, promoting calcium outflow through the intima, leading to vasodilation. Milrinone is a second-generation PDE-III inhibitor that has both positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects, and its positive inotropic effect is about 20 times that of azotocin. Milrinone can improve myocardial diastolic function and coronary perfusion. Its mechanism is to reduce left ventricular wall tension, increase left ventricular filling, and keep myocardial blood flow and oxygen supply in the best state. The method of medication is to first give a loading dose of $50 mu mathrm{g}/mathrm{kg}$ intravenous push ($10 sim 15$ minutes), followed by $0.25 sim 1.0 mu mathrm{g}/mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ continuous infusion to ensure the optimal plasma concentration. Since PDE-III inhibitors do not rely on adrenergic receptors for their effectiveness, they can be used in combination with adrenergic drugs when necessary. end{enumerate} 锜 is crucial for the excitation and contraction of the triceps muscles. When positive inotropic drugs are needed, appropriate blood calcium levels must be maintained.\n",
      "{(II) Application of negative inotropic drugs} In cases where excessive myocardial contractility leads to drastic fluctuations in hemodynamics, high blood pressure, and urgent need to relieve ventricular outflow obstruction (such as hypoxic attack in tetralogy of Fallot or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy), as well as controlled hypotension, negative inotropic drugs can be used under close monitoring. Negative inotropic drugs mainly include $ beta$ receptor antagonists and europium channel blockers. begin{enumerate} item $ beta$ receptor antagonists rapidly block cardiac $ beta$ receptors, reduce myocardial contractility and slow heart rate. Currently, the commonly used intravenous preparations in clinical practice are ekrolol and lenolol. Afenolol is a short-acting $ beta$ receptor antagonist, used for perioperative hypertension or tachycardia, with an initial dose of $0.5 mg/kg, intravenously injected within 1 minute, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of $0.05 mg/(kg cdot min) and subsequent dose adjustment based on patient response, with a maximum maintenance dose of $0.2 mg/(kg cdot min)$. Labetalol is a medium- to long-acting $ beta$ receptor antagonist, intravenously injected, and repeated after 15 minutes if necessary. The total dose should not exceed $200 mathrm{mg}$. For patients with pheocytoma, continuous intravenous administration can be used, and the total dose can reach $300 mathrm{mg}$. 1: {Chapter 15 Hemodynamic Monitoring and Clinical Application} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Drill channel blockers Among the drill channel blockers, verapamil has the strongest myocardial depressant effect. The intravenous dose is generally $5 sim 10 mathrm{mg}(0.075 sim 0.15 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg})$ each time, and the injection time is $3 sim 5$ minutes; the maintenance intravenous infusion dose is $3 sim 5 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. If the dose is too large, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, heart block and even acontraction may occur. Strong doses or positive inotropic drugs can antagonize the negative inotropic effect of verapamil, while bradycardia and atrioventricular block caused by verapamil need to be treated with isoproterenol or temporary pacing. end{enumerate} Appropriate preload, afterload and myocardial contractility are the three major factors to maintain hemodynamic stability. Although the regulation of hemodynamics can be handled in principle through the above three links, it is far from that simple in clinical practice. Hemodynamic changes caused by simple preload, afterload or myocardial contractile dysfunction account for only a few cases. Usually these factors are mixed with each other, and the condition is constantly changing. Therefore, for hemodynamic regulation, on the one hand, a regulation plan must be formulated based on the hemodynamic monitoring results and changing trends; on the other hand, these factors must be organically combined for comprehensive judgment and treatment, and then the regulation measures must be dynamically adjusted according to the changes in hemodynamic parameters during treatment. If necessary, the left ventricular function curve can be drawn through the simultaneously measured CO and PCWP (Figure 15-4), and the circulation status can be judged by the changes in the cardiac function curve to help guide the correct treatment. For example, the patient's hemodynamic monitoring and calculation results are as follows: blood pressure $80 / 40 mathrm{mmHg}$, heart rate 90 beats/min, cardiac index $2.0 mathrm{~L} / mathrm{min}$. $ left. mathrm{m}^{2} right)$, PCWP 18mmHg, peripheral vascular resistance $350( mathrm{kPa} cdot mathrm{s}) / mathrm{L} left[3500( mathrm{dyn} cdot mathrm{s}) / mathrm{cm}^{5} right]$. On the cardiac function curve, it is located at point 1, indicating that the patient has heart failure, hypotension, increased peripheral vascular resistance, and may be accompanied by volume overload. When treating, drugs that increase myocardial contractility (such as dopamine) are selected, which will move point 1 upward and slightly to the left to point 2; although CO and blood pressure can be increased at this time, PCWP is still at a high level. If vasodilators (such as sodium nitroprusside) are used to reduce afterload, point 1 can be moved to point 3, which can significantly reduce PCWP in addition to increasing CO. However, if the dosage of sodium nitroprusside is too high, the capacitative vessels will be over-dilated, or the urine volume will increase significantly after the use of diuretics, which will cause excessive reduction of preload, causing point 1 to move to point 4, resulting in further decreases in blood pressure and CO. Obviously, this should be avoided in treatment. The ideal treatment plan is to use positive inotropic drugs and vasodilators together, which can move point 1 to point 5, increase CO and blood pressure, and return PCWP to the normal range (Figure 15-4). When there is low cardiac output accompanied by increased peripheral vascular resistance, it is more appropriate to use peripheral vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside. begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-167} end{center} Figure 15-4 Cardiac function curve For patients with severe conditions, if cardiac output is still very low after positive inotropic drug treatment and peripheral vascular resistance is not high and preload is still very high, it indicates that myocardial function is very poor and difficult to improve, that is, the so-called refractory heart failure. Such patients often need mechanical support to overcome the difficulties. The most commonly used mechanical device in clinical practice is the intra-aortic bulb pump. In addition, according to the identification of left and right heart failure, left and right ventricular assist devices or complete heart support (ECMO) can be selected to improve the survival rate of such patients and buy time for further treatment. {Chapter 16 Monitoring of perioperative fluid balance} Body fluid is a solution formed by water as a solvent and electrolytes and non-electrolytes as solutes in the human body. Body fluid balance refers to the state in which the water, electrolytes, osmotic concentration and pH of each part of the body remain relatively stable within a certain range. If the body fluid imbalance exceeds the limit of the body's own regulation, it can affect physiological functions and in severe cases, it can endanger life. {Section 1 Monitoring of water and electrolyte balance during perioperative period} {I. Water and electrolyte components in body fluids} (I) Water Water is the main component of all body fluids in the human body. The total water content of the human body accounts for about $60%$ of the body weight of adults; it is generally lower in women, obese people and the elderly, and higher in infants and young children. Body fluids are divided into intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF); ICF accounts for about $2/3$ of the total water content (about $40%$ of body weight), and ECF accounts for about 1/3$ of the total water content (about $20%$ of body weight). About 3/4 of ECF is distributed in the interstitial tissue and the connective tissue around cells, which is called interstitial fluid (ISF); about $1/4$ is distributed in the blood vessels, which is called intravascular fluid (IVF), which is the main component of plasma. Most of the interstitial fluid can exchange rapidly with the intravascular fluid and achieve balance, which is called functional extracellular fluid, accounting for about 18% of body weight (including plasma), and is essential for maintaining blood volume. Extracellular fluid that cannot exchange with plasma is called non-functional extracellular fluid, mainly including cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, joint fluid, etc., accounting for about $1% sim 2%$ of body weight. Under pathological conditions, the production of non-functional extracellular fluid increases significantly, which can lead to water and electrolyte balance disturbance. The traditional classification method calls the intravascular space the first space, the extravascular space the second space, and the location of the non-functional extracellular fluid the third space. {(II) Electrolytes} begin{enumerate} item Sodium is the most abundant cation in the extracellular fluid and plays a decisive role in maintaining the osmotic concentration of the extracellular fluid. The sodium balance of the extracellular fluid depends on the intake and excretion of sodium. Under normal circumstances, sodium is mainly excreted through urine and is balanced with the intake; under pathological conditions (such as sweating, vomiting, diarrhea), sodium is also lost in large quantities through the extrarenal route. item Potassium is the most abundant cation in the intracellular fluid, and about $98%$ of the potassium in the body is distributed in the cells. Short-term potassium balance (balance between extracellular and extracellular) is regulated by insulin, $ mathrm{pH}, $, adrenergic receptor agonists and bicarbonate, while long-term potassium balance is regulated by the kidneys and aldosterone (by affecting clock excretion). item Calcium plays an important role in regulating muscle contraction, secretion, cell growth, and electrolyte transport. The kidney is the main regulator of calcium balance in the body, maintaining the blood calcium level at $2.25 sim 2.75 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. item Magnesium is related to the activation of about 300 enzyme systems and participates in many biochemical reactions in the body. Its deficiency can lead to serious consequences. The total amount of magnesium in the human body is about $21 sim 28 mathrm{~g}$. It is mainly excreted through the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. end{enumerate} {II. Regulation of water and electrolyte balance} begin{enumerate} item Thirst mechanism There is a thirst center on the side of the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Increased plasma crystal osmotic pressure, decreased effective blood volume and increased angiotensin II can all excite the thirst center and cause thirst. After drinking water, the stimulating factors are relieved and the thirst disappears. item Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is mainly secreted by the nerve cells of the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus and stored in the neurohypophysis. It can promote the reabsorption of water by the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys. Increased plasma crystal osmotic pressure, decreased circulating blood volume, painful stimulation, emotional tension, and increased angiotensin I can all promote the release of ADH. Increased arterial blood pressure can reflexively inhibit the release of ADH by stimulating the carotid subbaroreceptors. end{enumerate} {Chapter 16 Monitoring of fluid balance during perioperative period} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid secreted by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Its physiological function is to promote the active reabsorption of $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ by the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, and to promote the excretion of $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $ mathrm{H}^{+}$. As the reabsorption of $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ increases, the reabsorption of $ mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and water also increases. Therefore, aldosterone has the functions of retaining $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$, retaining water, excreting $ mathrm{K}^{+}$, and excreting $ mathrm{H}^{+}$. Decreased blood volume, decreased arterial blood pressure, decreased $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ flowing through the macula densa, and renal sympathetic nerve excitation can all lead to increased renin secretion, which in turn leads to increased secretion of angiotensin and aldosterone. item Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is mainly present in the cytoplasm of atrial myocytes, and exerts a sodium and diuretic effect by increasing the glomerular filtration rate and inhibiting the reabsorption of $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ by the renal medullary collecting duct. Increased blood volume causes ANP release by increasing right atrial pressure and stretching the atrial muscle. item Parathyroid hormone is secreted by the parathyroid glands and can promote the reabsorption of $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, inhibit the reabsorption of phosphate, $ mathrm{Na}^{+}, mathrm{~K}^{+}$, and $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ by the proximal tubules; it promotes the reabsorption of $ mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ by the renal tubules. Parathyroid hormone is regulated by the plasma $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. A decrease in the $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration can increase the secretion of parathyroid hormone, and vice versa. end{enumerate} {III. Diagnosis and treatment of common water and electrolyte imbalances}\n",
      "{(I) Hyponatremia} begin{enumerate} item Definition Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration lower than $135 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Acute hyponatremia is defined as a decrease in serum sodium from normal to below $135 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ within 48 hours. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the serum osmotic concentration as follows: end{enumerate} (1) Hyperosmotic hyponatremia: Excessive solute content in the extracellular fluid (such as intravenous mannitol, high blood sugar, etc.) causes an increase in plasma osmotic concentration, causing water to transfer from the intracellular to the extracellular space, resulting in an increase in circulating volume and a decrease in serum sodium concentration. (2) Isotonic hyponatremia: Due to an increase in solid matter in the plasma, the water content per unit volume decreases, and the plasma sodium concentration decreases due to the decrease in water content. This is seen in hyperlipidemia and hyperproteinemia. (3) Hypotonic hyponatremia: It can occur in three situations: increased, normal, or decreased extracellular fluid volume: (1) Hypervolemic hyponatremia, mostly due to water retention exceeding sodium retention, such as renal failure; or due to excessive water intake in a short period of time, such as transurethral prostatic resection syndrome (TURP syndrome); (2) Isovolemic hyponatremia, mostly due to excessive water intake and abnormal renal drainage function, such as psychogenic polydipsia, chronic adrenal insufficiency, etc.; (3) Hypovolemic hyponatremia, mainly due to the loss of electrolyte-containing body fluids and the supplementation of electrolyte-free fluids. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Clinical manifestations vary according to the severity and severity of the onset. (1) In acute hyponatremia, the clinical symptoms and signs are more obvious because water enters the brain cells faster and more. In chronic hyponatremia, the solutes in the cells move outward during the slow decrease of blood sodium, which causes the osmotic pressure in the nerve cells to decrease, and the water entering the cells is reduced, so the clinical symptoms and signs are also milder. (2) When serum sodium is higher than $125 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, there are usually no obvious clinical manifestations; when serum sodium is lower than $125 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, the main manifestations are digestive system symptoms (such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, etc.); when serum sodium is lower than $120 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, brain cell edema is obvious, and the main symptoms and signs are those of the central nervous system, manifested as staring, ataxia, convulsions, stupor, and even lethargy, convulsions, coma and increased intracranial pressure. (3) Patients with high-volume hyponatremia may have obvious edema, even systemic edema and ascites; patients who take in/absorb too much water in a short period of time may develop pulmonary edema, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Patients with low-volume hyponatremia may have low blood pressure, a weak and rapid pulse, and circulatory failure, as well as signs of dehydration. item Diagnosis Hyponatremia can be diagnosed when the serum sodium concentration is less than $135 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Since the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are often non-characteristic and easily masked by the primary disease, laboratory tests are an important basis for determining hyponatremia. end{enumerate} {4. Treatment} (1) Treat the cause: For example, stop infusing hypotonic sodium-free fluids, terminate surgery in time for patients with TURP syndrome, and limit fluid intake and diuresis. (2) Correct hyponatremia: The goal of treatment is to bring the plasma osmotic concentration close to normal levels. Sodium requirement can be calculated as follows: [ text { sodium requirement }( mathrm{mmol}) = text { body weight }( mathrm{kg}) times left(140- mathrm{Na}^{+} right) times 0.6 ] where $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ is $ mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Half of the calculated amount can be given within the first 8 hours; the other half can be given within the next $1 sim 3$ days. The optimal correction rate is $0.6 sim 1 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ per hour until the blood sodium concentration rises to $125 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$; the correction rate is then slowed down. Patients with severe neurological symptoms need to be treated with hypertonic saline ($3% mathrm{NaCl}$ solution) with the goal of raising the blood sodium concentration by $4 sim$ $6 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$; once the patient's neurological symptoms are relieved, they are supplemented at the normal rate. (3) Maintain blood volume: handle the relationship between hyponatremia and blood volume, and maintain normal extracellular fluid volume. For hypovolemic hyponatremia, normal saline can be given. For hypervolemic hyponatremia, water restriction, hypertonic saline supplementation, and diuretics should be added to reduce the increase in extracellular fluid caused by the increase in plasma osmotic pressure and the movement of fluid to the extracellular space. (4) While correcting the symptoms of hyponatremia, pay attention to potassium and magnesium supplementation, and correct acid-base imbalance. {(II) Hypernatremia} begin{enumerate} item definition If the serum sodium concentration is greater than $145 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, it is hypernatremia. Since $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ is the main cation in the extracellular fluid, hypernatremia must be accompanied by an increase in plasma crystal osmotic pressure. Hypernatremia can be divided into three types according to whether there is an alteration in the volume of extracellular fluid: (1) Hypervolemic hypernatremia, which is often caused by iatrogenic factors, such as excessive intraoperative infusion of sodium bicarbonate and hypertonic sodium chloride, and is also seen in some endocrine diseases such as primary aldosteronism; (2) Isovolemic hypernatremia, which is often caused by low water intake, excessive renal excretion, increased insensible water loss, etc.; (3) Hypovolemic hypernatremia, also known as hyperosmotic dehydration, is caused by loss of hypotonic fluid and is common in diabetes insipidus, severe diarrhea, vomiting, etc. Item Clinical manifestations (1) Thirst: A slight increase in serum sodium ($3 sim 4 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$) will cause a strong sense of thirst; if a conscious person does not feel thirsty, it means that the osmotic pressure receptors or cortical thirst center have been damaged. (2) Symptoms and signs of the central nervous system. As the serum sodium concentration and osmotic concentration increase, apathy, drowsiness, irritability, ataxia, tremor, increased muscle tension, spasms, and even death gradually appear. In acute severe hypernatremia, dehydration of brain cells can lead to brain shrinkage, rupture of meningeal blood vessels, and intracranial hemorrhage. After 24 hours of hypernatremia, the brain will gradually adapt, and the osmotic pressure in brain cells will gradually increase. As a result, the water in the extracellular fluid of brain cells will transfer into the cells. When hypernatremia occurs slowly, brain cells can gradually adapt by adjusting the volume, and the clinical manifestations of the nervous system may be mild. item Diagnosis Hypernatremia can be diagnosed when the serum sodium concentration is greater than $145 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. The clinical symptoms of hypernatremia are often masked by the underlying disease, and a comprehensive analysis based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests is required. end{enumerate} {4. Treatment} (1) Treatment sequence principle: By giving diuretics and hypotonic crystalloids, the normal osmotic concentration and volume of extracellular fluid are restored to eliminate excess sodium in the body. (2) Correct hypernatremia and reduce plasma osmotic concentration: Patients with acute hypernatremia need to quickly reduce plasma osmotic concentration to restore brain volume to normal; in chronic hypernatremia, patients have already adapted, and rapid correction will instead cause brain edema and even cause permanent brain damage. Therefore, the correction speed must be strictly controlled. The rate of serum sodium reduction should be $0.7 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ per hour, and the reduction should not exceed $10%$ of serum sodium concentration. (3) Maintain blood volume: Hypernatremia is often accompanied by an increase in extracellular fluid volume. A diuretic can be used, and $5%$ glucose solution can be given at the same time. If the extracellular fluid volume is normal, the amount of water deficit in the body can be calculated and $5%$ glucose solution can be transfused within 48 hours. If the extracellular fluid volume is reduced, the hypokalemia should be corrected first (normal saline can be given), and then 5% glucose solution should be used to replenish the volume after it is restored. {(III) Hypokalemia} begin{enumerate} item Definition I Serum potassium concentration below 3.5 mmol/L is hypokalemia. The causes of hypokalemia include: insufficient intake, such as fasting; gastrointestinal loss, such as vomiting, diarrhea, etc.; excessive renal loss, such as the use of potassium-excreting diuretics; potassium transfer into cells, such as acute alkalosis, insulin therapy, etc. item Clinical manifestations The main effect of hypokalemia is interference with neuromuscular function, which can lead to hyperpolarization of skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and myocardium, making it difficult to stimulate action potentials. (1) Cardiovascular system: It causes decreased myocardial contractility and abnormal cardiac conduction. Premature contractions and paroxysmal tachycardia can be seen. In severe cases, ventricular flutter and ventricular collapse may occur, leading to sudden death. The electrocardiogram shows the presence of U waves and TU fusion; when the blood potassium concentration is lower than $2.5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, ST segment depression and T wave inversion may occur. Digitalis poisoning is also prone to occur in hypokalemia. (2) Skeletal muscle: skeletal muscle weakness, slow or absent tendon reflexes, and in severe cases, muscle paralysis and dyspnea may occur. (3) Digestive system: abdominal distension, constipation, and in severe cases, paralytic intestinal obstruction. (4) Central nervous system: irritability, emotional agitation, lack of energy, craving for potassium, and in severe cases, mental disorders. Item Diagnosis The diagnosis can be made when the serum potassium concentration is lower than $3.5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Combined with the medical history and its impact on each system and the severity, the primary cause can be judged. Item Treatment Includes the cautious use of drugs and treatment measures that can further reduce blood potassium, treatment of the primary disease and potassium supplementation. Patients with mild hypokalemia who are conscious and can eat can take potassium supplements orally; those who cannot take it orally or have a large potassium deficiency need to take potassium supplements intravenously. Precautions for intravenous potassium supplementation: (1) Monitor urine volume. Patients with anuria should be cautious in taking potassium supplements; (2) In case of severe hypokalemia, potassium supplementation should be fast at first and then slow. Adults can take potassium supplements at a rate of $10 sim 20 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{h}$, use an infusion and monitor the electrocardiogram; (3) If alkalosis exists, it can often be corrected by correcting the hypokalemia; if acidosis exists, potassium should be supplemented before correcting the acidosis to prevent potassium from entering the cells after the $ mathrm{pH}$ rises, causing a further decrease in blood potassium; (4) If there is a combined magnesium abnormality, it should also be corrected at the same time. end{enumerate} {（四）Hyperkalemia} begin{enumerate} item Definition Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium concentration higher than $5.5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Causes include: excessive intake, reduced renal excretion, abnormal potassium distribution in the body, and massive destruction of tissue cells. item Clinical manifestations (1) Cardiovascular system: Hyperkalemia has an inhibitory effect on the myocardium, manifested as reduced contractility, reduced excitability, slowed conduction, and reduced automaticity. Severe arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest may occur. The electrocardiogram shows loss of $ mathrm{T}$ wave height, prolonged PR interval, and widened QRS wave. (2) Neuromuscular system: Increased blood potassium can increase the excitability of the neuromuscular system; but when blood potassium increases further, the excitability decreases, and numbness of the limbs and trunk, or even paralysis and respiratory muscle paralysis, occurs. (3) Digestive system: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur. (4) Central nervous system: manifested as apathy, dullness, drowsiness, and lethargy. Item Diagnosis The diagnosis can be made by combining medical history, comorbidities, and serum potassium concentration higher than $5.5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Because hyperkalemia can cause serious consequences, close observation is required. Item Treatment (1) Give calcium to counteract the inhibitory effect of hyperkalemia on the heart; (2) Promote the transfer of potassium into cells: intravenous infusion of glucose, insulin, sodium bicarbonate and/or $ beta$ adrenergic receptor agonists; (3) Promote potassium excretion: intravenous administration of diuretics, aldosterone agonists (such as fludrocortisone), and renal replacement therapy can be performed for patients with renal insufficiency; (4) Limit potassium intake, avoid the use of stored blood, etc.; (5) Treat the primary disease. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Monitoring of fluid osmotic concentration balance during perioperative period}\n",
      "{I. Basic concepts of body fluid osmosis} begin{enumerate} item Osmosis, osmotic pressure and osmotic concentration Osmosis is a physical phenomenon, which refers to the net movement of water on both sides of a semipermeable membrane due to the difference in the concentration of soluble substances on both sides of the membrane. Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to offset the movement of solutes (agents). Two conditions must be met for the generation of osmosis and osmotic pressure: first, there must be solutes in the solvent (water) to form a solution; second, a semipermeable membrane is required, which can only pass the solvent but not the solute, or can only pass small molecules but not large molecules. The magnitude of the osmotic pressure is proportional to the number of soluble solute particles, and has nothing to do with the form, size, volume or weight of the solute particles. Osmotic pressure includes crystal osmotic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure. Crystal osmotic pressure is generated by small molecule inorganic salts and non-dissociated solutes (such as urea, glucose, etc.). Colloidal osmotic pressure is generated by macromolecules (such as proteins, lipids, etc.), and its normal value is $25 sim 28 mathrm{mmHg}$. Osmotic concentration is the concentration of solute particles that produce osmotic effect in the solution, that is, the sum of the concentrations of various solute particles (such as anions and cations of electrolyte dissociation, etc.). end{enumerate} There are two units of osmotic concentration: weight osmotic concentration (osmolality), which refers to the number of milliosmoles contained in each kilogram of solution, with the unit of $ mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$; volume osmotic concentration (osmolarity), which refers to the number of milliosmoles contained in each liter of solution, with the unit of $ mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{L}$. Since the volume of the solvent is smaller than the actual volume of the solution, the value of weight osmotic concentration is always greater than the volume osmotic concentration. For example, the water content of plasma is about $93%$. If the plasma weight osmotic concentration is $280 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$, the converted volume osmotic concentration is $260 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{L}$; if the volume osmotic concentration is $280 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{L}$, the weight osmotic concentration is $301 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$. When the body temperature is $37^{circ} mathrm{C}$, the total plasma osmotic concentration of a normal person is $280 sim 310 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$. If it is lower than $280 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$, it is hypotonic, and if it is higher than $310 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$, it is hypertonic. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Effective osmotic molecules and ineffective osmotic molecules In the normal human body, the permeability of the cell membrane to different solutes is different. Solutes that cannot easily pass through the cell membrane into the intracellular fluid can form an osmotic gradient between the intracellular and extracellular fluids and cause water movement. These solutes that can produce osmotic phenomena are called effective osmotic molecules, such as sodium ions and glucose. Solutes that can freely pass through the cell membrane and cannot produce osmotic phenomena on both sides of the membrane are called ineffective osmotic molecules, such as urea. item Osmotic balance of body fluids The osmotic balance of body fluids mainly occurs inside and outside the cell membrane and inside and outside the capillary wall. It refers to the dynamic balance of osmotic pressure or osmotic concentration between the intracellular fluid and the extracellular fluid, and between the plasma and the interstitial fluid. Under normal circumstances, the body has the ability to keep the osmotic concentration of the extracellular fluid relatively stable, which is called the neuro-endocrine system regulation of body fluid osmosis. The normal adult osmotic pressure sensing interval is $280 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$. An increase of $1% sim 2%$ in the extracellular fluid osmotic pressure can stimulate the hypothalamic thirst center, causing thirst and ADH release. When blood volume and blood pressure change, they can also affect the secretion of $ mathrm{ADH}$ through volume receptors and pressure receptors. Thirst makes people drink water actively to replenish water. ADH can enhance the reabsorption of water by the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys and reduce water discharge. As a result, the water volume in the body increases and the plasma osmotic pressure returns to normal. Aldosteron and atrial natriuretic peptide are also important factors affecting water and sodium metabolism. end{enumerate} {II. Monitoring methods of body fluid osmotic concentration} begin{enumerate} item Freezing point osmotic concentration determination method Based on the proportional relationship between the freezing point depression value and the molar concentration of the solution, a highly sensitive temperature sensor is used to measure the freezing point of the solution, and the result is converted into the osmotic pressure unit $( mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg})$ by an electric tooth. The freezing point of pure water is $0^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. If a bath with an osmotic molar concentration of 1 is dissolved in $1 mathrm{~kg}$ of water, the freezing point of the water will change from $0^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ to $-1.857^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. To determine the osmotic concentration of a solution, we only need to determine the freezing point of the solution and calculate it according to the following formula: end{enumerate} [ mathrm{Os}( mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg})=( Delta mathrm{T} / 1.857) times 1000 ] Where, $ Delta mathrm{T}$ is the freezing point depression value of the slurry, and 1.857 is the molar freezing point depression constant of water. The freezing point principle measures the total osmotic concentration. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Semipermeable membrane determination method The method of directly determining the osmotic pressure of body fluids using a semipermeable membrane is mainly used for the determination of colloid osmotic pressure. The solution and pure water are placed in a U-shaped tube, and a semipermeable membrane is placed in the middle of the U-shaped tube to separate the water and the solution. Water can be seen moving through the semipermeable membrane to the solution side. When the osmotic pressure reaches a natural equilibrium, the hydrostatic pressure generated by the part of the solution side that is higher than the water surface is the osmotic pressure. Plasma colloidal osmotic pressure is mainly produced by protein. Under normal circumstances, the plasma protein concentration is $60 sim 70 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, and the measured osmotic concentration is about $1.3 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$, equivalent to $25 mathrm{mmHg}$. end{enumerate} {3. Calculation method} (1) Crystalline osmotic pressure calculation method: The following two methods are commonly used: Plasma osmotic concentration $=2 times left( left[ mathrm{Na}^{+} right]+ left[ mathrm{K}^{+} right] right)+[$blood glucose $]+[ mathrm{BUN}]$ Plasma osmotic concentration $=1.75 times left[ mathrm{Na}^{+} right]+[ mathrm{BUN}]+[$blood glucose $]+1.84 times left[ mathrm{K}^{+} right]+0.56 times left[ mathrm{Ca}^{2+} right]+0.56 times left[ mathrm{Mg}^{2+} right]$ The units in the formula are all $ mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Due to the complexity of the various components in body fluids, the calculated results are always lower than the measured values ​​and cannot completely replace the determination of osmotic concentration. (2) Calculation method of colloid osmotic pressure: Since plasma colloid osmotic pressure is related to the amount of plasma protein, it can be calculated based on the content of plasma protein. Common calculation method: Plasma colloid osmotic pressure $=$ albumin $ times 5.54+$ globulin $ times 1.43$ plasma colloid osmotic bed $=2.1 times$ total protein $+0.16 times$ total protein ${ }^{2}+0.009 times$ total protein ${ }^{3}$ In the formula, the units of each component are $ mathrm{g} / mathrm{dl}$, and the unit of plasma colloid osmotic pressure is $ mathrm{mmHg}$. {$ because$ Diagnosis and treatment of common fluid osmotic balance disorders} {(I) Blood hypotonic state} begin{enumerate} item Definition It refers to the plasma osmotic concentration $<280 mathrm{mO} mathrm{sm} / mathrm{kg}$. Causes include: too much water in the body (such as water intoxication); solute shortage; loss of osmotic fluid; loss of osmotic fluid greater than water loss. Common types include hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, and water retention. item Clinical manifestations Hyposmotic fluid shifts from intravascular to extravascular and from extracellular to intracellular, so clinical manifestations of tissue edema and intracellular edema appear. Brain cell edema may present with general fatigue, nausea, headache, nausea, palpitations, convulsions, coma, and eventually death from acute cerebral edema. Some patients may also have insufficient intravascular volume. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Diagnosis Based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and plasma osmotic concentration <280mOsm/kg, a diagnosis of blood hypoosmotic state can be made. Etiological diagnosis often requires comprehensive consideration of indicators such as urine osmotic pressure, plasma electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, protein, and arterial blood gas analysis (Table 16-1). end{enumerate} Table 16-1 Differential diagnosis of common causes of hypoosmolar state begin{center} begin{tabular}{ll} hline multicolumn{1}{c}{Laboratory test} & multicolumn{1}{c}{Cause} hline $U o s m<100 mathrm{mOsm} / mathrm{kg}$, urine specific gravity $<1.003$ & Psychogenic polydipsia, reestablishment of osmotic homeostasis Urine sodium $<15 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ & Gastrointestinal loss, late diuresis, burns, edema, simple cortisol insufficiency Urine sodium $>20 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ & Early diuresis, adrenocortical insufficiency, sodium-wasting nephritis, osmotic diuresis, anti- & syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone secretion hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Treatment The treatment principle is to limit water intake, use diuretics to promote water excretion, and appropriately supplement solutes to increase plasma osmotic concentration. The treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia can refer to the treatment of hyponatremia mentioned above. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Hyperosmotic state of blood} begin{enumerate} item Definition It refers to the plasma osmotic concentration $>320 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. Causes include: loss of pure water; insufficient water intake; loss of hypotonic fluid; solute overload. Common clinical types include hypernatremic hyperosmoticemia and hyperglycemic hyperosmoticemia. item Clinical manifestations Hyperosmoticity will cause body fluid to shift from the intracellular to the extracellular, leading to intracellular dehydration; osmotic diuresis caused by hyperosmoticity will cause decreased blood volume and insufficient tissue perfusion. Therefore, the clinical manifestations are symptoms of cellular dehydration and insufficient blood volume. In addition to increased plasma osmotic concentration, most hyperglycemia is accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis and decreased blood volume. Brain cell dehydration caused by hyperosmotic state can be manifested as extreme thirst, general weakness, muscle weakness, coma, convulsions, and finally death. item Diagnosis The diagnosis can be confirmed based on medical history, clinical manifestations and laboratory tests (including blood sugar, blood/urine ketone bodies and urine sugar concentration, etc.) (Table 16-2). end{enumerate} Table 16-2 Differential diagnosis of hyperglycemic hyperosmolarity begin{center} begin{tabular}{cccl} hline Blood glucose & Ketones & Acidosis & multicolumn{1}{c}{Cause} hline $>11 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ & + & Severe & Diabetic ketoacidosis $>33 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ & - & Mild, none & Hyperglycemic non-ketotic hyperosmolarity hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Treatment includes fluid replacement, insulin administration, correction of electrolyte imbalance and acidosis, and elimination of inducing factors. end{enumerate} (1) Fluid replacement: Fluid replacement therapy is crucial for patients with hyperglycemia. It can not only correct blood volume depletion and hyperosmolarity, but also help lower blood glucose and eliminate ketones. Infusion of isotonic saline solution is generally recommended. (2) Insulin treatment: First, inject insulin $0.1 sim 0.2 mathrm{U} / mathrm{kg}$ intravenously, then continuously infuse it at a rate of $0.1 mathrm{U} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$, so that blood sugar decreases at a rate of $3.3 sim 5.5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ per hour. When blood sugar drops to $14 sim 17 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, $5%$ glucose solution should be given and the insulin dose should be halved [i.e. $0.05 mathrm{U} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})]$ to prevent blood sugar and plasma osmotic pressure from dropping too quickly and causing cerebral edema. (3) Correction of electrolyte imbalance: Such patients often have significant sodium and potassium losses. Sodium loss can be corrected by supplementing sodium-containing fluids. Blood volume supplementation can promote potassium excretion through diuresis, while insulin therapy and elevated blood $ mathrm{pH}$ can promote potassium to enter cells, which can aggravate hypokalemia. Therefore, attention should be paid to the prevention and correction of hypokalemia. (4) Correction of acidosis: Mild acidosis does not require alkaline solution; if $ mathrm{pH}<7.1$, $1.4%$ sodium bicarbonate solution $200 sim 400 mathrm{ml} can be given intravenously, and the test should be repeated after 4 sim 6$ hours. Avoid the use of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate or sodium lactate. (5) Treatment of the cause. {Section 3 Monitoring of acid-base balance during perioperative period} {I. Basic physiology of acid-base balance} begin{enumerate} item Acid, base and buffer system According to Bronsted-Lowry's acid-base definition, substances that can release hydrogen ions $ left( mathrm{H}^{+} right)$ are acids, and substances that can bind $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ are bases. Therefore, acids and bases always exist at the same time in the human body, and $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ and conjugate bases are produced when the acid dissociates. end{enumerate} The buffer pair is composed of a weak acid $( mathrm{HA})$ and a weak conjugate base $ left( mathrm{A}^{-} right)$ produced by its decomposition: $ mathrm{HA} leftrightarrow mathrm{A}^{-}+ mathrm{H}^{+}$, which can both give $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ and accept $ mathrm{H}^{+}$, and is the buffer system that regulates acid-base balance in the human body. When $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ increases, combined with $ mathrm{A}^{-}$, the equilibrium reaction shifts to the left, reducing the increase of $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$; when $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ decreases, the solution of $ mathrm{HA}$ increases, the equilibrium reaction shifts to the right, reducing the decrease of $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$. The buffer pairs in plasma are $ mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} / mathrm{H}_{2} mathrm{CO}_{3}$, plasma protein radical/plasma protein acid, $ mathrm{Na}_{2} mathrm{HPO}_{4} / mathrm{NaH}_{2} mathrm{PO}_{4}$, among which $ mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} /$ $ mathrm{H}_{2} mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is more abundant in the extracellular fluid. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item The concentration of hydrogen ions in the body and $ mathrm{pH}$ Acidosis (alkalosis) is diagnosed based on $ mathrm{pH}$. When $ mathrm{pH}<7.35$, it is acidosis, and when $ mathrm{pH}>7.45$, it is alkalosis. The pathophysiological process of acidosis (base) is the accumulation of acidic (alkaline) substances in the blood and tissues in the body, causing the $ mathrm{pH}$ value of the blood to decrease (_increase). end{enumerate} The $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ produced in the cell flows to the outside of the cell through the transmembrane flow mechanism. Under normal circumstances, the $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ in the intracellular fluid is higher than that in the extracellular fluid, which are $80 sim 100 mathrm{nmol} / mathrm{L}$ and $40 mathrm{nmol} / mathrm{L} left(1 mathrm{~mol}=10^{9} mathrm{nmol} right)$ respectively. The $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ of the intracellular fluid cannot be routinely measured. In clinical practice, the measurement results of arterial blood are generally used as indicators reflecting the acid-base balance of the extracellular fluid. $ mathrm{pH}$ is the negative logarithm of $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ with base 10, so the higher the $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$, the lower the $ mathrm{pH}$. The $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ in the body must be maintained within a very narrow range. Excessive or low $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ can cause changes in protein charge, morphology and function, and even endanger life. The $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ range that the human body can tolerate is $16 sim 160 mathrm{nmol} / mathrm{L} left( mathrm{pH} 7.8 sim 6.8 right.$ )(Table 16-3). Acid-base balance is the process by which the body maintains the stability of $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ in the body.

(2) Respiratory regulation: When metabolic factors cause $ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ to rise (increase) and affect $ mathrm{pH}$, it can excite peripheral chemoreceptors and increase respiration, thereby reducing $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ to maintain $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} / mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ at $20:1, and mathrm{pH}$ is close to normal. (3) Renal regulation: The kidneys can excrete excess $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ from the body through reabsorption of $ mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, acidification of $ mathrm{Na}_{2} mathrm{HPO}_{4}$ in renal tubular urine (becoming $ mathrm{NaH}_{2} mathrm{PO}_{4}$), and ammonia secretion in the distal renal tubules to maintain normal $ mathrm{pH}$ of body fluids:\n",
      "{II. Monitoring of acid-base balance} Commonly used monitoring parameters are: begin{enumerate} item $ mathrm{pH}$ is the negative logarithm of body fluid $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$, which indicates the pH of body fluid. Since it is not possible to directly measure the $ mathrm{pH}$ in cells, the $ mathrm{pH}$ value of arterial blood is used to reflect the acidity of the internal environment. The normal value of $ mathrm{pH}$ in arterial blood is 7.35-7.45, reflecting the combined effect of respiratory and metabolic factors in the body. If $ mathrm{pH}$ is lower than 7.35, it is decompensated acidosis and acidemia exists; if it is higher than 7.45, it is decompensated alkalosis and alkalemia exists; $ mathrm{pH}$ between $ mathrm{7.35 sim 7.45$ may have three situations: no acid-base imbalance, compensatory acid-base imbalance or complex acid-base imbalance. However, it is not possible to determine whether the acid-base imbalance is respiratory or metabolic based on $ mathrm{pH}$ alone. item Bicarbonate ( bicarbonate, $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) is an indicator of the body's acid-base metabolism. It includes actual bicarbonate ( $ mathrm{AB}$ ) and standard bicarbonate ( $ mathrm{SB}$ ). $ mathrm{AB}$ refers to the actual $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ content in plasma measured under actual conditions, with a normal range of $22 sim 27 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ and an average of $24 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}; mathrm{SB}$ refers to the $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ content in arterial blood measured under the conditions of $37^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2} 40 mathrm{mmHg}, and mathrm{SaO}_{2} 100%$. $ mathrm{AB}$ is affected by both respiratory and metabolic factors, and $ mathrm{AB}$ abnormality may be the result of metabolic acid-base imbalance or renal compensation during respiratory acid-base imbalance. item Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure $ left( mathrm{PaCO}_{2} right)$ is the pressure generated by physically dissolved $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules in arterial blood. The normal value is $36 sim 44 mathrm{mmHg}$, and the average value is $40 mathrm{mmHg}$. $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ can be used to evaluate alveolar ventilation and is an indicator of respiratory acid-base balance. item Buffer bases (BB) are the sum of all buffering bases (negative ions) in blood (whole blood or plasma), including $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, hemoglobin, plasma proteins and $ mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{2}$-, etc. The normal value is $45 sim 55 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}. mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ is the main component of $ mathrm{BB}$, which can reflect the body's total buffering capacity when the acid-base balance is disturbed. If $ mathrm{BB}$ decreases and $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ is normal, it indicates that there is a shortage of base reserves other than $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and it is inappropriate to supplement $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. item Base excess (BE) and base deficit (BD) refer to the amount of acid or base required to titrate the $ mathrm{pH}$ of plasma or whole blood to 7.40 under standard conditions (blood temperature $37^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2} 40 mathrm{mmHg}$, and hemoglobin is fully oxygenated). The normal value is $ pm 3 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, and the average value is 0. Anyone who needs to add acid indicates that there is too much base in the body, which is called base excess; anyone who needs to add alkali indicates that there is too much acid in the body, which is called base deficit. Since the determination excludes respiratory interference, $ mathrm{BE}$ or $ mathrm{BD}$ is an important indicator reflecting metabolic acid-base balance. item Anion gap (anion gap, AG) is the difference between the total cation concentration and the total anion concentration routinely measured in serum. The calculation formula is $ mathrm{AG}= left[ mathrm{Na}^{+} right]- left( left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]+ left[ mathrm{Cl}^{-} right] right)$, and the normal value is $8 sim 16 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}. mathrm{AG}$ is of great significance in the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. Regardless of whether $ mathrm{pH}$ is normal or not, as long as $ mathrm{AG}$ is greater than $ mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, metabolic acidosis can be diagnosed, so an increase in $ mathrm{AG}$ is synonymous with metabolic acidosis. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{III. Diagnosis and treatment of common acid-base disorders} begin{enumerate} item Respiratory acidosis is an acid-base disorder caused by primary respiratory disturbances leading to an increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, manifested as arterial blood $ mathrm{pH}<7.35, mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>44 mathrm{mmHg}$. end{enumerate} (1) Cause: Due to insufficient alveolar ventilation, the $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by the body's metabolism cannot be eliminated, resulting in an increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. Causes of hypoventilation include: (1) central respiratory depression; (2) ventilation dysfunction (such as myasthenia gravis, muscle relaxant residue, airway obstruction, etc.); (3) increased dead space ventilation (such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism); (4) excessive $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production (such as burns, malignant hyperthermia, etc.). (2) Clinical manifestations: 1) Central nervous system: anxiety, disorientation, confusion, dyspnea, etc. $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is too high ( $>70 mathrm{mmHg}$ ) can lead to $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ anesthesia, manifested as drowsiness, stupor, or even coma; patients under general anesthesia will experience delayed awakening. Hypercapnia can lead to cerebral vasodilation, resulting in symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, slow reaction, optic disc edema, etc. (2) Cardiovascular system: Sympathetic-adrenal medullary system excitement manifests as high blood pressure, tachycardia, increased cardiac output and other circulatory hyperdynamic states. Negative inotropic effects manifest as low blood pressure, decreased cardiac output and other circulatory inhibition states. (3) In respiratory acidosis, since $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ flows from the extracellular to the intracellular, and $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ flows from the intracellular to the extracellular, the patient may experience hyperclockwise blood flow. (3) Diagnosis: The diagnosis can be made based on the medical history and blood gas analysis results. If the blood gas analysis results are significantly different from the expected values, mixed acid-base disturbances should be considered. (4) Treatment: The goal is to remove the inducing factors, improve alveolar ventilation function, and restore $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ to the basic level. For example, mask-assisted breathing or mechanically controlled breathing, antagonizing the residual effects of general anesthesia drugs, etc. At the same time, oxygen therapy is given to correct hypoxemia. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Respiratory alkalosis is an acid-base imbalance caused by a decrease in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ due to primary respiratory disorders, manifested as arterial blood $ mathrm{pH}>7.45, mathrm{PaCO}_{2}<36 mathrm{mmHg}$. end{enumerate} (1) Cause: Due to alveolar hyperventilation, the $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eliminated exceeds the $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by the body, resulting in a decrease in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. The causes include: (1) Excessive ventilation, such as hypoventilation, hypotension, central nervous system diseases, etc.; (2) Reduced $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production by the body, such as a decrease in metabolic rate caused by anesthesia, hypothermia, etc. (2) Clinical manifestations: Acute hypocapnia may cause: (1) central nervous system dysfunction, with patients experiencing dizziness, decreased judgment, confusion and even coma; (2) increased neuromuscular irritability, with paresthesia, tetany or spasms; (3) cerebral vasoconstriction, leading to local cerebral ischemia; (4) reduced cardiac output; often accompanied by hypokalemia, and in severe cases, arrhythmia. (3) Diagnosis: diagnosis can be made based on medical history and blood gas analysis results. If the results of blood gas analysis $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]$ are significantly different from the expected value, there may be a mixed acid-base disorder. (4) Treatment: For patients with spontaneous breathing, the only effective treatment is to remove the inducing cause, such as giving $ mathrm{O}_{2}$ inhalation to patients with hypoxemia, treating lung diseases, and giving analgesia to patients with pain. In mechanically ventilated patients, minute ventilation can be reduced to restore $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ to baseline levels (usually $ mathrm{mmHg}$ ). begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Metabolic acidosis is an acid-base imbalance caused by primary metabolic disorders that lead to a decrease in $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]$ and an increase in $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$, manifested as arterial blood $ mathrm{pH}<7.35$, and at the same time $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]<20 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ or $ mathrm{BE}<-3 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}_{ circ}$ end{enumerate} (1) Cause: According to the carbonate buffer system equilibrium formula, the increase in $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ leads to the consumption of $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and the shift of the balance to the left, $ The consumption of $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ increases the anion gap; when $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ is lost, the balance shifts to the right, $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$ also increases, and the production of new anions keeps the anion gap unchanged. The causes of metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap are: (1) excessive acidic substances, such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, etc.; (2) renal insufficiency, mainly due to reduced glomerular filtration rate, which reduces the excretion of organic acid anions. The causes of metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap are: (1) direct $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ loss, which is seen in diarrhea, intestinal fistula, etc., or when using carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetamide); (2) indirect $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ loss, organic acid anions are not reabsorbed after glomerular filtration, resulting in $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ accumulation in the body. (2) Clinical manifestations: Metabolic acidosis can lead to dysfunction of multiple systems. (1) Central nervous system: patients experience fatigue, drowsiness, confusion, and even coma; (2) Respiratory system: initially, ventilation increases, but acidosis can impair muscle contractility and eventually lead to respiratory failure; (3) Cardiovascular system: early on, it is a manifestation of sympathetic-adrenal medullary system excitement; when $ mathrm{pH}$ is lower than 7.20, myocardial contractility gradually decreases, and coupled with dilation of capacitance and resistance vessels, patients often experience hypotension; if hypotension reduces tissue blood perfusion and oxygen supply, lactic acidosis can be further aggravated; (4) Prolonged metabolic acidosis can deplete the body's $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ reserves. Although the blood clock can remain normal, once the metabolic acidosis is corrected and the $K^{+}$ distribution returns to normal, hypokalemia can occur; (5) In acute acidosis, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen decreases, resulting in reduced blood oxygen carrying and oxygen delivery capacity. (3) Diagnosis: The following steps can be used for analysis: (1) Whether metabolic acidosis exists; (2) Whether the respiratory system response is normal. If $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ cannot be restored to an appropriate level, it indicates that the patient also has respiratory acid-base disturbance; (3) Whether metabolic acidosis exists without increased plasma anion metabolism. (4) Treatment: General treatment measures include maintaining airway patency, maintaining stable circulation, and facilitating oxygen inhalation. Etiological treatment depends on the results of differential diagnosis. Severe metabolic acidosis requires supplementation of $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}$. When the normal $ mathrm{pH}$ is greater than 7.2, there is no need to supplement sodium bicarbonate; when $ mathrm{pH}$ is less than 7. 2, the treatment should be decided based on a comprehensive analysis of the $ mathrm{pH}$ and $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]$ conditions. Generally, treatment is given when $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]$ is lower than $15 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. The dosage of $ mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ can be calculated based on the loss of $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ in the extracellular fluid: total $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3} right]$ loss per $( mathrm{mmol})=$ body weight $( mathrm{kg}) times 0.2( mathrm{ECF}$ percentage of body weight $) times$ alkali. When treating metabolic acidosis, attention should be paid to supplementing $ mathrm{K}^{+}$, because as the anemia is corrected, the flow of $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ into the cells may aggravate the hyponatremia. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Metabolic alkalosis Acid-base imbalance due to primary metabolic disorder resulting in an increase in $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]$ and a decrease in $ left[ mathrm{H}^{+} right]$. Ifif, the acid-base imbalance is manifested as arterial I III $ mathrm{pH}>7.45$, and at the same time $ left[ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]>30 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ or $ mathrm{BE}>2 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. end{enumerate} (1) Disease IV: The metabolic end product is rarely alkaline, so alkalosis is usually caused by excessive acid loss or administration of exogenous drugs.\n",
      "{Chapter 16 Monitoring of perioperative fluid balance} Acid loss is caused by: (1) direct loss of $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $ mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ during vomiting or continuous gastric tube suction; (2) when using thiazide diuretics and oxadiuretics, the loss of $ mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ in urine is greater than the loss of $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $ mathrm{K}^{+}$, and the excess $ mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ is excreted together with $ mathrm{H}^{+}$ or $ mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. In metabolic alkalosis, the main compensatory mechanism is the decrease in alveolar ventilation and the increase in $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ increases or decreases by $10 mathrm{mmHg}$, which will be accompanied by a $ mathrm{pH}$ decrease or increase of 0.08 units. In chronic metabolic alkalosis, compensation can be achieved by inhibiting tubular secretion of $ mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ and stimulating increased lactate production. (2) Clinical manifestations: The most serious consequence of metabolic alkalosis is respiratory depression leading to insufficient ventilation and increased $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, and mechanically ventilated patients will have difficulty weaning from the machine. If hypoxemia occurs, a decrease in $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ can offset the respiratory depression of alkalemia to a certain extent; however, patients receiving oxygen therapy may experience severe respiratory depression. In alkalemia, the affinity of hemoglobin for $ mathrm{O}_{2}$ increases, and the oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left, which can further aggravate tissue hypoxia. In case of compensatory hypercapnia, since $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier, it can cause confusion, lethargy, and coma in patients. In addition, patients with metabolic alkalosis often have hypokalemia, which can cause arrhythmia and muscle weakness. (3) Diagnosis: The cause of metabolic alkalosis (excessive alkali intake or acid loss) can often be determined based on the medical history. Most patients have reduced extracellular fluid volume and decreased urine $ mathrm{Cl}^{-} right]$ ( $<20 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ ), which can be used for differential diagnosis based on the medical history. (4) Treatment: On the basis of clarifying the cause, correct the inducing factors such as improper use of diuretics or vomiting. Symptomatic treatment mainly involves identifying the missing components and supplementing them. For patients with insufficient extracellular fluid volume, $ mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $ mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ should be supplemented. Since such patients are often accompanied by $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ deficiency, $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ supplementation is often required at the same time. In severe alkalemia $( mathrm{pH}>7.70)$, $ mathrm{HCl}$ or $ mathrm{NH}_{4} mathrm{Cl}$ can be given to directly supplement $ mathrm{H}^{+}$; patients on dialysis can reduce alkalemia by reducing the concentration of $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} right]$ or acetate in the dialysate. Another treatment approach is to use carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetylpiperidone) to reduce the reabsorption of $ mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ by the proximal renal tubule. At this time, it should be noted that $ mathrm{K}^{+}$ loss is also increased. begin{verbatim} (王东信涓婷婷) end{verbatim} {第十止音Perioperative Fluid Therapy} Body fluid is a solution in the body formed by water as solvent and electrolytes and non-electrolytes as solutes. Body fluid balance refers to the state in which the water content and distribution of each part of the body, the electrolyte composition and distribution, the osmotic concentration and the pH value remain relatively stable within a certain range, and the stability of the circulatory function is maintained. Body fluid balance is the basic condition for maintaining life. The main function of blood circulation is to supply the oxygen and energy required for the body's metabolism and to excrete metabolic products from the body. The so-called circulatory failure refers to the obstruction of tissue perfusion and insufficient coordination. Therefore, the purpose of treatment is to restore tissue blood perfusion and oxygen supply. The main factors affecting tissue blood perfusion include: the volume of body fluid in the blood vessels, the heart function, the perfusion pressure of organs and tissues, and the factors affecting the distribution of body fluid. Whether the treatment during anesthesia is appropriate is directly related to the life safety of surgical patients and the effect of disease treatment. Perioperative fluid therapy is an important part of maintaining stable vital signs and good tissue perfusion in patients undergoing surgery, and is also the basis for treating diseases. The purpose of fluid therapy is to maintain the patient's effective circulating volume, increase cardiac output (CO), and provide adequate tissue perfusion for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients. During surgery, patients need to replenish the amount of fluid to maintain normal physiological functions, as well as the amount of fluid loss caused by various causes, including trauma, blood loss, loss of peritoneal and pleural fluid, sweating, and the effects of anesthesia. If the perioperative fluid therapy measures are inappropriate, resulting in insufficient circulating volume, poor tissue perfusion, cell metabolism disorders, and organ function damage can occur, which can affect the patient's prognosis. {Section 1 Evaluation of Perioperative Effective Circulating Blood Volume} At present, the evaluation of whether an individual's blood volume is sufficient or the effect of fluid therapy is generally based on clinical manifestations and signs, or on whether the hemodynamic parameters are stable. Hemodynamic parameters can be divided into three aspects: pressure (arterial pressure, CVP, PCWP), volume ( $ mathrm{CO} , mathrm{SV})$ and oxygen metabolism index $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} , mathrm{VO}_{2} , mathrm{SVO}_{2} right)$ . However, none of these indicators directly measure the volume in the blood vessels, and their sensitivity in measuring blood volume varies. {I. Analysis of body fluid volume} During fluid therapy, we must first ensure that the blood volume is sufficient, especially the stability of the effective circulating blood volume, which is the basis for maintaining hemodynamic stability. The judgment of volume is the key to maintaining body fluid balance, and the judgment of monitoring results should emphasize comprehensive analysis, mainly referring to the comprehensive analysis of medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, and various monitoring results. This is the basic skill of an excellent clinician. begin{enumerate} item Medical history and etiology are of great significance in judging the nature of body fluid imbalance and the severity of hypovolemia. For example, trauma can cause bleeding and fluid retention, peritonitis can lead to severe isotonic dehydration, pyloric obstruction and vomiting can cause dehydration, hypochloremic alkalosis and hypokalemia. item Assessment of basic conditions before surgery Including: bleeding site, blood loss, presence of hemothorax, etc. Understand the complications related to anesthesia and the effect of anesthesia on circulatory capacity. For example, spinal anesthesia can block the sympathetic nerves and dilate peripheral blood vessels, and the effective circulating blood volume can be reduced by about $500 mathrm{ml}$; inhaled anesthetics can dilate peripheral blood vessels and lower blood pressure; although intravenous anesthetics have little effect on heart rate and cardiac output, they can also reduce peripheral resistance and lead to circulatory instability. Therefore, sufficient fluids should be supplemented or vasoactive drugs should be used to maintain circulatory stability. item General monitoring of clinical symptoms: thirst level, mental state, etc. Physical signs: such as skin elasticity, eyeball depression, neck vein fullness, etc., can reflect dehydration and its degree. Observing the presence of tissue edema can reflect whether there is water retention in the body. Generally speaking, if a fast heart rate, low blood pressure, low urine output, and low tolerance to anesthetics occur during anesthesia, the first thing to consider is the possibility of insufficient blood volume. item Hemodynamic monitoring There is no direct method for monitoring blood volume in clinical practice. A comprehensive evaluation based on the results of hemodynamic monitoring is required to make a correct judgment. Therefore, patients with a large number of intraoperative blood volume need to monitor CVP, and patients with severe and complex operations also need to establish other invasive hemodynamic monitoring methods. end{enumerate} {II. Non-invasive circulatory monitoring indicators} In order to correctly evaluate whether perioperative blood volume is sufficient, heart rate and blood pressure, urine output, pulse oxygen saturation waveform and its related changes with respiration should be routinely monitored during anesthesia and surgery. begin{enumerate} item Heart rate (HR) When circulatory function is unstable, the first changes are heart rate and blood pressure. The speed of the heart rate mainly depends on the autonomy of the sinus node and the blood volume. When blood volume decreases, heart rate often increases compensatorily, which is also an important manifestation of the compensatory period of hemorrhagic shock. Item Blood pressure Blood pressure monitoring usually uses non-invasive cuff blood pressure. Arterial pressure is related to the heart's preload and afterload and myocardial contractility. Therefore, when blood volume decreases, arterial pressure can decrease. It should be pointed out that arterial pressure and CVP should be analyzed synchronously when judging blood volume. end{enumerate} Table 17-1 Analyzing the circulation status from the relationship between blood pressure and heart rate changes has certain reference significance for clinical practice.

If the intraoperative urine volume can be maintained above $1.0 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$, it means that the blood volume and organ perfusion pressure are normal. However, during anesthesia surgery, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone increases, which can affect the body's urination, so the urine volume cannot reflect the changes in blood volume in real time. The fullness of the jugular vein, the skin color and temperature of the limbs are also effective indicators for judging blood volume during surgery. item Pulse oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SpO}_{2} right) quad mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ is an important perioperative monitoring item. If the $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ waveform changes with the respiratory cycle, it indicates that the patient has insufficient blood volume; but if the $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ waveform does not change with the respiratory cycle, it cannot rule out insufficient blood volume in the patient. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{III. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring indicators} For patients undergoing major surgery, in addition to routine monitoring indicators, CVP is often required to be monitored. For patients with severe and complex surgery, invasive monitoring technology is also required to monitor hemodynamic changes. begin{enumerate} item Invasive arterial blood pressure (IABP) is a reliable circulatory monitoring indicator. Continuous monitoring of arterial pressure waveforms and related changes in respiratory movements is of great clinical significance in determining whether the effective circulating blood volume is sufficient. The main factors affecting mean arterial pressure (MAP) are: myocardial contractility, preload and afterload. Under the premise of maintaining CVP (preload) within the normal range, the stability of MAP depends on cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. If the pressure change of arterial blood pressure related to respiratory movement is $>13%$, and the contraction rate drops by $geqslant 5 mathrm{mmHg}$, it indicates insufficient blood volume. item Central venous pressure (CVP) refers to the average pressure of the superior and inferior vena cava or right atrium located in the chest cavity. It mainly reflects the balance between right heart function and venous return to the heart, and is a commonly used monitoring indicator for judging blood volume during surgery. The normal value is 5～$12 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$. Less than: $5 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ indicates poor left atrial filling or insufficient blood volume; greater than $15 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$ indicates blood volume overload or right heart dysfunction. It should be emphasized that a single CVP measurement value should not be viewed mechanically, and it should not be forced to speed up the infusion to reach the so-called positive value of CVP, which often leads to infusion overload. In critically ill patients, continuous observation of the dynamic changes of CVP is more meaningful than a single measurement value for clinical guidance. The relationship between CVP and blood pressure changes is of great significance for clinical analysis of the condition (Table 17-2). end{enumerate} Table 17-2 Clinical significance of the relationship between CVP and blood pressure begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} hline CVP & Blood pressure & Clinical significance hline low & low & Insufficient blood volume hline low & normal & Only slightly insufficient blood volume hline inj & low & Cardiac function is incomplete, relatively excessive blood volume hline pulmonary artery & insufficient blood volume constriction, high pulmonary artery resistance hline normal & low & Cardiac discharge $ downarrow$, excessive blood volume constriction, insufficient or normal blood volume hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) PAWP is a reliable indicator for assessing left ventricular preload and left ventricular function, and is more sensitive than CVP in reflecting vascular volume. When PAWP is lower than $6 mathrm{mmHg}$, it means that the cardiac preload is too low, the effective circulating blood volume is insufficient, and there is hypovolemia. Within a certain range, an increase in preload can increase cardiac output. However, when PAWP is higher than $18 mathrm{mmHg}$, it means that the cardiac preload is too high. The use of diuretics or vasodilators to reduce preload and PAWP is beneficial to maintaining normal cardiac output. Cardiac output (CO) refers to the volume of blood ejected into the aorta or pulmonary artery by the left or right ventricle per minute. Measuring $ mathrm{CO}$ is helpful in judging cardiac function, and can calculate cardiac index, peripheral vascular total resistance, etc., which has important guiding significance for guiding clinical treatment. The $CO$ of a normal adult is $5 sim 6 mathrm{~L} / mathrm{min}$, and the stroke volume ( $ mathrm{SV}$ ) is $60 sim 90 mathrm{ml}$. According to $ mathrm{CO}$ and cardiac preload, a cardiac function curve can be drawn to guide clinical fluid and drug treatment. However, $ mathrm{CO}$ varies greatly between individuals, especially closely related to body surface area. Therefore, the cardiac index (CI), which is obtained by dividing CO by body surface area, is a useful parameter for comparing cardiac output in different individuals. Cardiac output is a quantitative indicator to measure the function of cardiac reservoir blood, but when analyzing the reasons for reduced cardiac output, a comprehensive analysis should be conducted in combination with the intracardiac pressure value to make a correct diagnosis (Table 17-3). end{enumerate} Table 17-3 Identification of Causes of Reduced Cardiac Output begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} hline Causes & CVP & PAWP & PAPd/PAWP hline Low IIIL heart failure & $ downarrow$ & $ downarrow$ & PAPd $=$ PAWP hline Left heart failure & $-1 uparrow$ & $ uparrow$ & PAPd $=$ PAWP hline Left heart failure & $ uparrow$ & - & PAPd>PAWP hline includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-180} & $ uparrow$ & - & PAPd>PAWP hline includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-180(1)} & $ uparrow$ & $ uparrow$ & PAPd = PAWP hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-180(2)} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) is an effective indicator for clinical judgment of cardiac volume. $EDV=$ stroke volume (SV)/ejection fraction (EF). Left heart EDV is measured by echocardiography, and right heart EDV is measured by floating catheter. There is a significant correlation between the changes in SVI and SVV and the changes in volume load. The normal value of SVI is $25 sim 45 mathrm{mV} /$ (beat. $ mathrm{m}^{2}$ ). SVV is also a parameter for clinically judging blood volume. Its principle is to judge whether the blood volume is sufficient by the amplitude of the change in the arterial waveform with positive pressure ventilation. Both have important clinical value for the evaluation of effective circulating blood volume and guiding intraoperative fluid therapy. SVV reflects the degree of variation of stroke volume within a certain period of time. The greater the degree of variation of SV, the more serious the degree of effective blood volume deficiency. In this case, if the volume load is increased, the degree of CO increase will be more obvious. SVV can be used to evaluate the effect of fluid therapy and predict the ability of the heart to respond to volume load, that is, the sensitivity of the circulatory system to volume therapy. end{enumerate} {IV. Other related monitoring indicators} begin{enumerate} item Arterial blood $ mathrm{pH}($ arterial $ mathrm{pH})$, gastrointestinal intramucosal $ mathrm{pH}$ and blood lactate $ mathrm{pHa} backslash mathrm{pHi}$ and blood lactate are indicators that reflect the state of tissue oxygen metabolism. If tissue perfusion is insufficient, anaerobic metabolism increases, lactate content increases, and $ mathrm{pHa} and mathrm{pHi}$ both decrease. Therefore, if there is a possibility of insufficient circulating blood volume and tissue perfusion, $ mathrm{pHa}, mathrm{pHi}$ and blood lactate should be monitored in time to determine whether the disorder of tissue oxygen metabolism is caused by insufficient circulating blood volume, which plays an important guiding role in the fluid therapy of patients undergoing anesthesia surgery. item Mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$ and central venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{ScvO}_{2} right) quad mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ are important parameters reflecting tissue oxygen balance, which can reflect both oxygenation function and changes in circulatory function. The normal value of $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is $70 % sim 75 %$; below $60 %$, it reflects that systemic tissue oxygenation is threatened; below $50 %$ indicates severe tissue hypoxia; above $80 %$ indicates insufficient oxygen utilization. $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ refers to $ mathrm{SO}_{2}$ of superior vena cava blood or right atrial blood, which has a good correlation with $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$, can reflect tissue perfusion and oxygenation status, and its normal value is higher than $75 %$. Monitoring $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ can identify and treat potential tissue hypoxia in the early stages of the disease, especially hypoxia caused by insufficient tissue perfusion due to low blood volume. item Hemoglobin ($ mathrm{Hb}$) and hematocrit (Hct) In the anemic state, the body's compensatory mechanisms include: (1) increased cardiac output; (2) redistribution of blood flow to organs throughout the body; (3) increased oxygen uptake rate of certain tissue vascular beds; (4) regulation of the ability of $ mathrm{Hb}$ to bind oxygen. When the amount of intraoperative bleeding is large or the amount of fluid transfer is large, the hemoglobin content and Hct should be monitored to understand the body's oxygen supply to avoid reduced oxygen supply due to insufficient tissue perfusion, leading to oxygen metabolism disorders. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Principles of fluid therapy} Perioperative fluid therapy is an important part of maintaining circulatory stability and has its own particularity. It should be avoided that excessive or insufficient fluid in the body affects or delays the patient's recovery. The study of perioperative fluid therapy strategies has a long history. Intraoperative fluid therapy was in the exploratory stage in the 1960s, but it was confirmed that the fluid requirements for complex trauma surgery significantly exceeded the normal physiological fluid maintenance volume. In the following decades, the focus was on the selection of fluids, and in recent years, there has been a trend towards goal-oriented fluid management strategies. The ultimate goal of intraoperative fluid therapy is to avoid occult hypovolemia and tissue hypoperfusion caused by insufficient infusion and cardiac insufficiency and peripheral tissue edema caused by excessive infusion; it is necessary to ensure satisfactory blood volume and appropriate anesthesia depth, counteract the damage that may be caused by surgical trauma, and ensure satisfactory tissue perfusion and normal organ function.\n",
      "{I. Fluid requirements during anesthesia and surgery} Fluid therapy strategies during anesthesia and surgery should focus on five aspects: (1) preoperative fluid loss, mainly preoperative fasting and abnormal fluid loss in patients before surgery; (2) vasodilation or relative hypovolemia caused by anesthesia; (3) physiological requirements during surgery; (4) surgical bleeding; (5) distribution of fluid to the third space caused by surgical trauma. begin{enumerate} item Estimation of daily physiological requirements of the human body during the perioperative period Calculate the normal physiological fluid requirement per unit time according to the method in Table 17-4. The perioperative physiological interval should be calculated from the time the patient enters the operating room until the end of the operation. end{enumerate} Table 17-4 Normal physiological fluid requirements of the human body begin{center} begin{tabular}{ccc} hline Weight & fluid requirement $[ mathrm{mV} / mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})]$ & fluid requirement $[ mathrm{mV}( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})]$ hline First $10 mathrm{~kg}$ & 100 & 4 Second $10 mathrm{~kg}$ & 50 & 2 All subsequent $10 mathrm{~kg}$ & $20 sim 25$ & 1 hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Preoperative loss and intraoperative physiological requirements Because patients must fast and abstain from drinking before anesthesia, a certain degree of fluid loss will occur. Patients may also have abnormal fluid loss, such as vomiting, diuresis, etc. Before anesthesia, attention should also be paid to other abnormal explicit or implicit fluid loss, such as excessive ventilation, fever, sweating, etc. The above are all preoperative fluid loss, which should be supplemented before anesthesia or at the beginning of anesthesia. The fluid loss caused by fasting can be estimated according to the fasting time; the physiological needs during surgery are calculated according to time; abnormal body fluid loss should be estimated according to the condition and clinical manifestations. It is mainly supplemented with electrolyte balance solution. item Body fluid redistribution during surgery Mainly includes: part of the fluid in the blood vessels is transferred to the interstitial tissue; surgery causes plasma, extracellular fluid and lymph loss; inflammation, stress, trauma cause a large amount of fluid to seep to the serosal surface or transfer to the intercellular space, generally the intestinal cavity, abdominal cavity, retroperitoneal cavity and pleural cavity, etc., becoming non-functional extracellular fluid; hypoxia causes cell swelling, resulting in an increase in intracellular fluid volume. Depending on the degree of surgical trauma, the amount of body fluid lost is also different (Table 17-5). The above fluid loss can lead to a decrease in circulating blood volume, and all should be supplemented with crystalloid + colloid fluid, but crystalloid should be the main component. end{enumerate} Table 17-5 Fluid loss in different surgeries begin{center} begin{tabular}{lc} hline Degree of trauma & Fluid loss during surgery $[ mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})]$ hline Less than surgery & 4 Moderate surgery & 6 Greater than surgery & 8 hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Relative blood volume deficiency caused by vasodilation due to anesthetic factors Anesthetic treatment (such as antihypertensive treatment), anesthetic drugs, and anesthetic methods (continuous epidural block, spinal anesthesia, and general anesthesia, etc.) can cause varying degrees of vasodilation, leading to a decrease in effective blood volume. In order to maintain circulatory stability and tissue perfusion within the normal range, the degree of volume deficiency should be evaluated according to different individuals, anesthesia methods and drugs, and crystalloid or colloid fluid should be supplemented in time to maintain effective circulating blood volume. Generally speaking, when achieving the same volume expansion effect, colloid fluid is more effective and the dosage is significantly less than crystalloid fluid. If crystalloid fluid is used alone for supplementation, the required amount may be very large, which may cause postoperative edema of intestinal, lung, muscle and other tissues. item Blood loss during surgery Surgical bleeding is an important cause of changes in body fluids in patients during anesthesia and surgery. Surgical blood loss mainly includes the loss of red blood cells, plasma and coagulation factors, and can lead to a decrease in blood volume, so targeted treatment measures should be taken. The judgment of blood loss during surgery is very important. At present, the more accurate method for evaluating blood loss is the weighing method, that is, the weight difference before and after the gauze absorbs blood (especially the monitoring of bleeding during pediatric surgery), plus the amount of blood sucked in the suction bottle is the total blood loss. However, there are many factors that affect the estimation of blood loss during surgery, such as the organs and tissues removed, the use of flushing fluid, etc., which will affect the accuracy of the estimated blood loss. Therefore, the determination of hemoglobin and hematocrit (Hct) should be combined to comprehensively evaluate the amount of blood loss. end{enumerate} {II. Principles of fluid therapy} begin{enumerate} item Prioritize blood volume replenishment. Determine how much and what to replenish based on the amount of fluid required and the nature of the lost body fluid. However, when the effective circulating blood volume is insufficient, it should be corrected first to provide a stable volume basis for hemodynamics. There are two common clinical situations: (1) There is no obvious deficiency in total body fluid, but the effective circulating blood volume is insufficient. At this time, the main thing to replenish is the vascular content, mainly colloid fluid, and crystalloid fluid is mainly used to replenish the basic and additional loss. (2) Total body fluid is insufficient, and the effective circulating blood volume is also insufficient. First, end{enumerate} {Chapter 17 Perioperative Fluid Therapy} correct the deficiency of effective circulating blood volume to maintain circulatory stability, mainly replenishing colloid fluid; while replenishing blood volume, it is also necessary to replenish the deficiency of functional extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid, mainly replenishing crystalloid fluid. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Treatment of intraoperative blood loss For blood loss during surgery that leads to blood volume loss, the amount of blood loss should be assessed based on clinical manifestations and monitoring results. The blood volume should be supplemented mainly with colloid and crystalloid solutions, but colloid solutions should be the main solution. This is because colloid solutions are significantly better than crystalloid solutions in terms of the effect and duration of maintaining intravascular volume. end{enumerate} (1) Concentrated red blood cells: Whether or not concentrated red blood cells need to be transfused depends mainly on the actual value of the patient's hemoglobin $( mathrm{Hb})$. The human body has a certain compensatory capacity for blood loss. When the red blood cell level drops to a certain level, it needs to be supplemented. Clinical studies have confirmed that surgical patients can safely tolerate anesthesia and surgery when $ mathrm{Hb} 100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ or Hct is above 0.30. For critically ill patients (ASA III $ sim$ IV grade, such as myocardial ischemia and emphysema), it is best to maintain $ mathrm{Hb}>100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L} (100 sim 120 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ ). When the patient's $ mathrm{Hb}<70 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ (or $ mathrm{Hct}<0.21$ ), concentrated red blood cells should be supplemented in time. The amount of concentrated red blood cells supplemented during surgery can be calculated according to the following formula: Concentrated red blood cell supplement amount $=$ $ left( mathrm{Hct}_{ text {实的倠 }} times 55 times right.$ body weight) $/ 0.60$ . (2) Plasma: When severe blood loss has a significant impact on the body's internal environment and coagulation system, it is necessary not only to supplement red blood cells, but also to supplement fresh frozen plasma and other coagulation factors to maintain normal coagulation function. The supplementation of coagulation factors and platelets mainly relies on the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and platelets (PLT). According to data from North America and Europe, only 30% of normal coagulation factors or 5% to 20% of unstable coagulation factors are needed to maintain normal coagulation function in the body. However, there is no research data in this regard in China, and symptomatic treatment should be carried out in a timely manner according to clinical symptoms and monitoring results. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains all the protein components and coagulation factors in plasma. The main indications include: (1) Supplementation of coagulation factor deficiency. (2) Reversal and replacement therapy of anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin. Each unit (200-250ml) of FFP can increase the coagulation factor of an adult by about $2% sim 3%$. That is, using $10 sim 15 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$ of FFP can maintain $30%$ of coagulation factor and achieve normal coagulation state. (3) FFP is also commonly used in cases where bleeding continues after massive blood transfusion and platelet supplementation. FFP can also be used for patients with fibrinogen deficiency. FFP needs to be warmed to $37^{circ} mathrm{C}$ before transfusion. (3) Platelets: When platelets are obviously lacking $left(leqslant 50 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L} right)$ and platelet function is abnormal, platelet concentrates should be supplemented. When there is a large amount of blood loss (>5000ml) and FFP is supplemented, if there is still obvious bleeding in the surgical field, platelet concentrates should be transfused. Each unit of platelet concentrate can increase the platelet count by $(7.5 sim 10) times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$. Cryoprecipitate mainly contains $VIII factor, bifactor, vWF and fibrinogen. One unit of $FFP}$ can separate one unit of cryoprecipitate, which does not require $mathrm{ABO}$ matching and can be used immediately after dissolving. One unit of cryoprecipitate contains about $250 mathrm{mg}$ of fibrinogen. Using 20 units of cryoprecipitate can restore patients with severe fibrinogen deficiency to the necessary level. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Rationally choose solution preparations There are two types of solution preparations used in clinical practice: colloid solution and crystalloid solution. Crystalloid solution can replenish blood volume, extracellular fluid and electrolytes. The use of crystalloid solution therapy is beneficial for the prevention and treatment of renal failure after shock, but it is easy to produce tissue edema. Colloids have a significant effect on plasma volume expansion. Most of them remain in the blood vessels after infusion. Small molecule colloids also have a diuretic effect at the beginning. Large molecule colloids can remain in the blood vessels to maintain blood volume. If used together with hypertonic crystalloids, it is more conducive to volume expansion therapy. Item Determine the order and speed of infusion The order of infusion is mainly determined by the condition and needs. For example, blood transfusion should be given as soon as possible in the case of massive blood loss. The speed of infusion depends on: (1) the degree of fluid loss, especially the degree of effective circulating blood volume and ECF loss; (2) the type of infused fluid; (3) the condition, especially the heart, lung and kidney function; (4) monitoring results. During the infusion process, monitoring and adjustment should be carried out, and the patient's main complaint should be closely observed. Blood pressure, heart rate, urine volume, and whether there are symptoms such as worsening of the condition or heart failure should be monitored. It should be emphasized that it is impossible to judge the patient's fluid requirements completely accurately in clinical practice. Dynamic observation should be strengthened and the infusion plan should be adjusted continuously according to the specific situation until the body fluid balance is restored. end{enumerate} {Section 3 Commonly used infusion preparations} The solutions used for perioperative fluid therapy include crystalloid and colloid.\n",
      "{(I) Crystalloids} Crystalloids contain small molecular weight ions. The solutes in crystalloids are less than $1 mathrm{~nm}$. The molecules are arranged in an orderly manner. When a light beam passes through, it does not refract and can remain in the blood vessels. Therefore, its volume expansion effect is not as good as that of colloidal solutions. Commonly used crystalloids are: begin{enumerate} item Glucose injection Glucose is an important nutrient and energy source for the human body. $5%$ glucose solution is an isotonic solution, but it is rapidly converted into $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water in the body. After $5%$ glucose solution is injected intravenously, only $1/14$ can be retained in the blood vessels. Increased blood sugar during surgery, limited urinary tract infection, and the adverse effects of high blood sugar on the ischemic nervous system all limit the use of glucose solutions during surgery. It is mainly used to supplement water and heat; treat hypoglycemia; often used in combination with insulin to promote the transfer of potassium ions into cells and treat hyperglycemia. item Sodium chloride injection Sodium chloride injection replenishes blood volume and sodium and chloride ions, and maintains the balance of water, electrolytes and osmotic pressure. Commonly used in clinical practice are isotonic $0.9%$ sodium chloride injection (normal saline) and compound sodium chloride solution (Ringer's solution). In addition to $ mathrm{Na}^{+} and mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, Ringer's solution also contains $ mathrm{K}^{+} and mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and its composition is closer to plasma. It is mainly used for patients with severe water and sodium loss, such as burns, shock, severe vomiting and diarrhea, etc.; fluid replacement for hypotonic dehydration and volume expansion for patients with hypotension and shock. item Lactated Ringer's solution Lactated Ringer's solution contains sodium lactate $3.10 mathrm{~g}$, sodium chloride $6.00 mathrm{~g}$, potassium nitride $0.30 mathrm{~g}$, platinum nitride ( $ left. mathrm{CaCl}_{2} cdot 2 mathrm{H}_{2} mathrm{O} right) 0.20 mathrm{~g}$, and appropriate amount of water for injection. It is mainly used to regulate body fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance, supplement effective extracellular fluid, reduce blood viscosity and improve microcirculation. It is suitable for intraoperative fluid replacement and prevention and treatment of shock. When a large amount of infusion is given, the plasma albumin concentration decreases, which can lead to interstitial pulmonary edema. Liver dysfunction, severe shock with hypoxia and children should avoid transfusion-induced hyperlactatemia. item Sodium bicarbonate solution Sodium bicarbonate is a weak alkaline drug that can directly increase the body's alkaline reserve and prevent metabolic acidemia. It can also improve the effect of vasoactive drugs by correcting acidemia, increase myocardial irritability, increase myocardial ventricular threshold, and reduce blood clock concentration. It is the first choice for correcting metabolic acidosis in the perioperative period. Application precautions: (1) It should not be used in excess or continuously. Blood gas monitoring should be performed to avoid alkalosis. (2) It should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, acute or chronic renal failure, clock deficiency, or carbon dioxide retention. (3) It should not be used blindly in large quantities during cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation, and good lung ventilation must be ensured to expel $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$. item Acetate Ringer solution Acetate Ringer solution has a $ mathrm{pH}$ of 7.4 and is a source of water and electrolytes and an alkalizing agent. Its gluconate and acetate are finally metabolized into $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water after being oxidized in the body. The metabolism of acetate is not completely dependent on the liver, and it can be converted into bicarbonate in the liver and extrahepatic tissues; the conversion is faster than lactate, and the metabolism is more complete than lactate; the alkalization ability is stronger than lactate, and the buffering effect is better than lactate. end{enumerate} {(II) Colloidal fluid} Colloidal fluid contains macromolecular substances, such as protein, hydroxyethyl starch and gelatin. The solute of the colloidal fluid is $1 sim 100 mathrm{~nm}$, and refraction can occur when the light beam passes through. The generated colloidal osmotic pressure can keep the solution in the blood vessels. The indications for the use of colloidal fluid mainly include: (1) patients with insufficient intravascular volume, such as hemorrhagic shock; (2) the need to increase or supplement intravascular volume during anesthesia; (3) treatment of severe hypoproteinemia or large protein loss (such as burns). Most artificial plasma substitute solutions are macromolecular substances dissolved in physiological saline, and the half-life in the blood vessels is 3 to 6 hours. Currently, the commonly used artificial plasma substitute solutions are hydroxyethyl starch and gelatin. Artificial plasma substitute solutions have a low allergy rate and have little effect on kidney and coagulation function within a safe range. begin{enumerate} item Dextran 40 (dextran 40, low molecular weight dextran) The average relative molecular mass of dextran 40 is 40,000. Its volume expansion effect is slightly shorter, but its effect on improving microcirculation is relatively low. It is suitable for anti-shock, various blood diseases, and limb replantation. However, it should be noted that in a small number of patients, it can cause severe swelling of renal tubular cells, which may cause renal tubular occlusion and renal failure; excessive infusion of red blood cells may cause red blood cell aggregation; false aggregation may occur during blood typing and cross-testing; it may also cause bleeding tendency and osmotic nephropathy. Therefore, patients with heart failure, bleeding tendency and renal impairment should use it with caution. Occasionally allergic reactions may occur. The clinical dosage is 250-500 ml each time, and the total amount per month should not exceed $20 ml/kg. Item Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) Its physical and chemical properties: Depends on the degree of hydroxyethylation and molecular size, it is divided into low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (Mw < 100000 D), medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (Mw 100000 300 000 D) and intermediate molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (Mw> 300 000 D). According to the degree of substitution (expressed by the average molecular substitution level Ms), it is divided into: low substitution level (Ms 0.3-0.5), medium substitution level MSO.6 and high substitution level HES (Ms $ geqslant 0.7$). The higher the substitution level, the less likely it is to be decomposed by starch, and the longer it stays in the body, but the greater the impact on the kidney and coagulation function. In order to achieve the unity of effectiveness and safety, the early high molecular weight, low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch or high substitution level hydroxyethyl starch is gradually being replaced by medium molecular weight low substitution level HES. HES 200/0.5 (HES ${ }^{@}$) is a medium molecular weight low substitution level hydroxyethyl starch powder solution made from corn branched chain starch. The average molecular weight is about 200,000 Daltons, the molar substitution level is about $0.5, the mathrm{pH} 3.5 sim 6.5$, and the colloid osmotic pressure is about $36 mathrm{mmHg}$. The half-life is 3-4 hours, and it is metabolized by the kidneys. Hers can increase the plasma colloid osmotic pressure, increase the ingestion of drugs, improve hemodynamics, oxygen supply and consumption, and prevent capillary blockage. The allergic reaction is low. The volume expansion effect of Hers (equal to the actual plasma increase/infusion amount $ times 100%$) is $100%$, and can be maintained for 4 hours, and there is still $72%$ after 8 hours. HES 130/0.4 (HES 130/0.4) is a medium molecular weight, low substitution level hydroxyethyl starch solution with an average molecular weight of about 130,000 Daltons, a molar substitution level of about $0.4, and a pH of 4.0 sim 5.5$. HES 130/0.4 has a volume expansion effect of $100%$ and can be maintained for $4 sim 6$ hours. It can be used for isotonic hemodilution to maintain blood volume for at least 6 hours. Hydroxyethyl starch is suitable for shock treatment, prevention and treatment of hypotension after anesthesia, intraoperative volume supplementation, isovolumetric or hypervolumetric hemodilution, and priming of cardiopulmonary circulation machines. It is contraindicated for patients with severe coagulation disorders, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and starch allergy. It should be noted that high doses can affect kidney and blood function; allergic reactions are very rare $(<0.1 %)$; serum amylase may increase during infusion. The daily dose and infusion rate should be determined according to the amount of blood loss and the degree of hemoconcentration. The amount of 6% Hess should not exceed 33 ml/kg per 24 hours, the amount of 10% Hess should not exceed 20 ml/kg per 24 hours, and the amount of 10% Hess should not exceed 50 ml/kg per 24 hours. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Succinylated gelatin, also known as Jialeshi or Xuedingan, is prepared by hydrolyzing and acylation of bovine collagen. Its main component is $4%$ sterilized amber gelatin (modified liquid gelatin), with an average molecular weight of $30000 mathrm{D}$, sodium content of $154 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, nitrogen content of $125 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}, mathrm{pH}$ of $7.4 pm 0.3$, colloidal osmotic pressure of $34 mathrm{mmHg}$, half-life of 4 hours, and metabolism through the kidneys. It can increase the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood plasma and increase blood volume. The peak value of the volume expansion effect is $70%$, which can be maintained for 2 hours, and then $35%$. It can improve hemodynamics, oxygen delivery, and blood rheology. It has little effect on coagulation function and does not interfere with cross-matching. The incidence of allergic reactions is $0.1% sim 0.5%$. If histamine blockers are given in advance, the incidence of histamine release can be reduced. It is suitable for correcting or preventing circulatory insufficiency caused by lack of plasma or whole blood volume. It is suitable for hypovolemic shock, whole blood or plasma loss (such as due to trauma, burns, preoperative blood dilution and autologous blood transfusion), cardiopulmonary circulation machine priming and prevention of hypotension that may occur during spinal anesthesia or continuous epidural blockade. In clinical application, the dose and infusion rate should be adjusted according to individual conditions and circulatory monitoring parameters (such as blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, urine volume, etc.). When a large dose is infused, it should be closely monitored to maintain the hematocrit not less than $21%$, and pay attention to the effect of dilution effect on coagulation function. item Hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 40 is a hypertonic and hyperosmotic solution that can expand blood volume and has a longer effect time. It is mainly used for acute hypovolemic shock. For patients with hemorrhagic shock, it can maintain circulatory stability, increase tissue oxygen supply and oxygen uptake, improve microcirculation, and increase survival rate. It is contraindicated for patients who are allergic to this drug, those with hemorrhagic diseases, those with severe heart dysfunction, and those with liver and kidney dysfunction. When using it, you should pay attention to the following: (1) A small number of patients may have allergic reactions; (2) The recommended infusion rate is $10 sim 15 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{min}$, and the maximum dosage does not exceed $750 mathrm{ml}$; (3) It can cause hypercapnia and hyperchloremia. Item Plasma albumin (allbumin) comes from human blood, so it is expensive, difficult to obtain, and has the risk of spreading diseases. Its colloid osmotic pressure is about $20 mathrm{mmHg}$, which is similar to the plasma osmotic pressure. Infusion of albumin can significantly increase the colloid osmotic pressure of patients with reduced colloid osmotic pressure, and maintain the vascular content for a longer time. Each $1 mathrm{~g}$ albumin can maintain $15 mathrm{ml}$ of water in the blood vessels. Compared with other colloid fluids, serum albumin has the least effect on coagulation. There is no evidence that the use of albumin can reduce the mortality rate of patients compared with artificial colloid fluids; most scholars believe that albumin is particularly suitable for diseases with intravascular protein loss, such as peritonitis and sub-severe burns. $25%$ albumin solution contains 5 times the normal concentration of albumin, which is a hypertonic solution. It is suitable for patients with blood pressure maintenance, total extracellular fluid has been replenished, and plasma volume has decreased. end{enumerate} (Huang Wenqi) {Chapter 1: Perioperative Blood Protection and Rational Blood Transfusion} Blood is a precious resource for humans, and blood transfusion therapy is one of the important treatment methods in modern medicine. However, with the continuous deepening of related research, more and more evidence shows that allogeneic blood transfusion may lead to a variety of serious complications. With the continuous development of medical technology, especially the continuous expansion of the surgical field, the clinical demand for blood products has increased year by year. At present, all countries in the world are facing the problem of insufficient blood supply. The purpose of blood protection is to use limited blood resources in a planned and scientific manner to prevent it from being lost, destroyed and spreading diseases. The perioperative period is a high incidence period of blood loss and transfusion therapy. Therefore, clinical physicians should fully master the principles and common techniques of perioperative blood protection and rational transfusion. Blood protection is listed as one of the five major organ protections during the perioperative period, along with myocardial protection, lung protection, brain protection and kidney protection. {Section 1 Component transfusion and transfusion indications}\n",
      "{I. Blood component transfusion} The purpose of blood transfusion includes increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and correcting coagulation disorders. Since the optimal storage temperature of each component in the blood is different, storing whole blood at $4^{circ} mathrm{C}$ can preserve red blood cells, but platelets and coagulation factors are destroyed in a short time. Therefore, transfusing stored whole blood cannot achieve the purpose of improving coagulation function. At the same time, the incidence of transfusion reactions when transfusing whole blood is significantly higher than that of transfusing red blood cells. In recent years, the concept of component transfusion has gradually become a consensus. The so-called component transfusion refers to the separation of different components of donor blood by scientific methods, and the storage of each component according to the optimal conditions required by each component. The corresponding blood products are supplemented according to the blood components lost or lacking by the patient (Table 18-1). The advantages of component transfusion include: relatively safe, less adverse reactions; can reduce the occurrence of transfusion-transmitted diseases; component blood products have small volume, high concentration and purity, and good therapeutic effect; easy to store and use; less impact on the immune function of tumor patients; save blood resources, one person donates blood, and many people benefit.

      "{II. Indications for blood transfusion} Faced with increasingly scarce blood resources and the possible spread of blood-borne diseases, countries have successively issued their own clinical transfusion guidelines, and have continuously revised the guidelines based on the latest clinical research results. In 2000, the Ministry of Health of China promulgated the \"Technical Specifications for Clinical Blood Transfusion\", which stipulates the indications for the use of major blood component products as follows. begin{enumerate} item Red blood cells Red blood cells are suitable for anemic patients who need to improve the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, whose blood volume is basically normal or whose hypoglycemia has been corrected. When hemoglobin $( mathrm{Hb})>100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, no transfusion is required; $ mathrm{Hb}<70 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ should be considered; when $ mathrm{Hb}$ is between $70 sim$ $100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, whether to transfuse should be determined based on factors such as the patient's degree of anemia, cardiopulmonary compensatory function, whether the metabolic rate is increased, and age. Real-time monitoring of $ mathrm{Hct} / mathrm{Hb}$ is the basis for effective implementation of transfusion indications, so $ mathrm{Hb}$ detectors should be equipped in operating rooms or ICUs. When the patient's $ mathrm{Hb}$ is between $70 sim 100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, clinical signs can be used to determine whether the patient's oxygen supply and demand are balanced. If the blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and body temperature are normal, $ mathrm{Hb}>70 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ is completely tolerable. The amount of concentrated red blood cells required can be estimated according to the following formula: end{enumerate} [ text {concentrated red blood cells required }( mathrm{ml}) = left( mathrm{Hct}_{ text {needed count }}- mathrm{Hct}_{ text {actual }} right) times 70 times text { body weight }( mathrm{kg}) / 0.6 ] Where 0.6 is the average Hct value of transfused red blood cells. In my country, a rough estimate can be made based on the fact that each unit of red blood cell suspension transfused can increase the hemoglobin of most adults by $5 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) FFP is suitable for patients with perioperative coagulation and deficiency. The main function of FFP is to supplement coagulation factors and fibrinogen to improve coagulation function. The misconception that FFP is a volume expander and can promote wound healing should be corrected. Indications for the use of FFP include: PT or APTT>1.5 times normal, diffuse bleeding on the wound surface, acute massive bleeding patients who have received a large amount of stored whole blood or concentrated red blood cells (the amount of bleeding or transfusion is equivalent to the patient's own blood volume); history or clinical course show congenital or acquired coagulation dysfunction; emergency counteracting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin (FFP: 5～ $8 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$). In fact, as long as the fibrinogen concentration is greater than $0.8 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, even if the coagulation factor is only $30%$ of the normal level, the coagulation function may still remain normal. Even if the patient's blood replacement reaches the total blood volume, there will actually be $1/3$ of the autologous components (including coagulation factors) retained in the body, and effective coagulation function can still be maintained. Each unit of FFP can increase the coagulation capacity of an adult by about $2 % sim 3 %$. Therefore, the dosage should be adjusted in time according to clinical symptoms and monitoring results. Generally, $10 sim 15 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$ is enough to improve shock symptoms begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Platelets I Platelets are suitable for patients with decreased platelet count or abnormal platelet function accompanied by bleeding tendency. When the platelet count is $>100 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$., no transfusion is necessary; when the platelet count is $<50 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$., transfusion should be considered; when the platelet count is between $50 and $100 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$., the decision should be made based on whether there is spontaneous bleeding or wound bleeding. If uncontrollable bleeding occurs during surgery or if platelet function is confirmed to be low, platelet transfusion is not subject to the above restrictions. This is because low platelet function (such as secondary to preoperative aspirin treatment) has a more important effect on bleeding than platelet count. Before transfusing platelets, the type and extent of surgery, bleeding rate, ability to control bleeding, knowledge of the patient, and related factors that affect platelet function (such as extracorporeal circulation, renal failure, and medication for severe liver disease) should also be judged. The platelet count of parturients may be lower than $50 times 10^{circ} / mathrm{L}$ (pregnant idiopathic thrombocytopenia), and platelet transfusion is not necessarily required. The peak value after platelet transfusion determines the therapeutic effect, so it should be transfused quickly and used in sufficient quantity at one time. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Autologous blood transfusion} Autologous blood transfusion can avoid blood-borne diseases and immunosuppression, and will not cause complications such as alloimmunization and graft-versus-host disease after transfusion. It is also the only blood source for patients who cannot obtain allogeneic blood for a while. There are three methods of autologous blood transfusion: preoperative autologous blood storage, acute isotonic blood thinning and blood recovery. {I. Preoperative autologous blood storage} begin{enumerate} item Definition Autologous blood storage refers to the method of collecting the patient's own blood for in vitro storage within a certain period of time before the operation, and then returning it to the patient after blood loss during the operation. Item Indications and contraindications Autologous blood storage technology is suitable for patients who are estimated to have intraoperative bleeding volume exceeding $15%$ of circulating blood volume, patients who have developed immune antibodies to blood transfusion, patients with blood type problems or who have had difficulty matching blood, and patients who do not accept allogeneic blood transfusions due to religious beliefs. Contraindications include: patients with hematopoietic dysfunction and coagulation dysfunction; patients with $ mathrm{Hb}<100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$; patients with combined heart, lung, and kidney dysfunction; patients with combined cystic erythritis. Item Steps Depending on the number of blood storages required, autologous blood can be collected $2 to 4$ weeks before surgery. Each blood collection should not exceed $500 mathrm{ml}$ (or $10%$ of the autologous blood volume), and the interval between two blood collections should be no less than 3 days. Blood collection should be completed 3 days before surgery. The collected autologous blood can be separated, and the separated concentrated red blood cells and fresh cold-refined plasma can be stored separately to obtain coagulation factors. Similarly, white blood cell platelet component blood can be collected before surgery as needed. Blood collection can stimulate erythropoiesis. Studies have found that when the red blood cell count decreases by $10% sim 20%$, the bone marrow hematopoietic cells increase by $2 sim 3$ times. Giving patients iron, vitamin C and folic acid (recombinant human erythropoietin can be used if conditions permit) before and after blood collection can further accelerate endogenous erythropoiesis. end{enumerate} {II. Acute normovolemic hemodilution} begin{enumerate} item Definition Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) refers to the process of extracting a certain amount of the patient's own blood after anesthesia and before the start of the main bleeding step of the operation, and at the same time transfusing colloid or isotonic crystalloid to keep the blood volume unchanged, so as to reduce the hematocrit and reduce the loss of formed blood components during bleeding during the operation; then, the autologous blood is transfused back to the patient according to the intraoperative blood loss and the patient's condition, so as to avoid or reduce the transfusion of allogeneic blood. In general, the ratio of crystalloid to blood transfusion is $4:1$, and the ratio of colloid to blood transfusion is $1:1$. Blood to be transfused within 4 hours can be stored at room temperature, otherwise it should be marked and placed in a $4^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ refrigerator, and transfused within 24 hours as needed. item Indications and contraindications Patients with good respiratory and circulatory function and good general condition, hemoglobin $ geqslant 110 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L} ($ hematocrit $ geqslant 0.33$ ), if there is a large amount of blood loss during the operation or it is necessary to reduce blood density and improve microcirculatory perfusion, end{enumerate} includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-188(1)} donation, coagulation dysfunction, poor intravenous infusion access and lack of monitoring conditions. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Degree of blood dilution and blood collection volume In most cases, HCL is used to guide blood dilution. Because of hemodilution, Hct $0.25 sim 0.3$ is called moderate hemodilution, and Hct $<0.2$ is called extreme hemodilution. While ensuring adequate oxygen supply to the body, there is no clear conclusion on the lowest level to which Hct can be reduced, but a large number of clinical and experimental studies have shown that moderate hemodilution is safe. In the process of hemodilution, the effect on the coagulation system must also be considered. It is currently believed that platelets must be kept above 50x $10^{9} / mathrm{L}$, and fibrinogen should be kept above $0.3 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$. Patients with normal coagulation system before dilution can ensure that the above indicators are above the lower limit after moderate isovolumetric hemodilution. According to the Hct baseline value and target value, the approximate blood collection volume can be calculated according to the following formula: begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-189} end{center} Blood pressure, pulse, and blood oxygen saturation should be routinely monitored during blood collection. Central venous pressure can be monitored when necessary. In addition, Het or $ mathrm{Hb}$ must be monitored. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Effects and advantages of hemodilution Arterial oxygen content decreases after hemodilution, but adequate oxygen supply is not affected. The main compensatory mechanism is the increase in cardiac output and tissue oxygen uptake rate. ANH can also reduce blood viscosity and improve tissue perfusion. Compared with stored autologous blood transfusion, ANH is simple, inexpensive, and can better preserve platelets and coagulation factors in the blood. Some patients who are not suitable for preoperative autologous blood collection and storage can safely undergo $ mathrm{ANH}_{ text {。 }}$ under the close supervision of anesthesiologists. Patients suspected of bacteremia cannot undergo stored autologous blood transfusion, but ANH will not cause bacteria to multiply in the blood. Blood recovery is not recommended for tumor surgery, but $ mathrm{ANH}_{ text {。 }}$ can be applied end{enumerate}\n",
      "{III. Blood Recovery} begin{enumerate} item Definition Blood recovery refers to the technology of using a blood recovery device to process the blood accumulated in the patient's body cavity, surgical blood loss and postoperative drainage blood and then return it to the patient. According to the different methods of collecting and processing the blood, it can be divided into washing blood recovery and filtering (non-washing) blood recovery. Although filtering blood recovery has the advantages of low cost, simple technology and rapid recovery, from the perspective of safety and scope of application, washing blood recovery is more widely used. item Indications and contraindications Blood recovery has a wide range of applications. It can be used in most surgeries with large amounts of bleeding, and can also be used to recover postoperative drainage blood. However, the following situations are not suitable for blood recovery: blood has been out of the blood vessel for more than 6 hours; the blood is suspected to be contaminated by bacteria, feces, amniotic fluid or venom; the surgical field contains malignant tumor cells; the blood is severely hemolyzed; and there are collagen hemostatic materials in the surgical field or antibiotics that are not suitable for intravenous application are used to flush the surgical field. item Steps Cleaning blood recovery uses negative pressure to collect surgical bleeding, and uses heparin or sodium thiocyanate for anticoagulation, and then stores it in a blood storage tank after filtering through a filter; when the collected blood volume reaches a certain volume, the blood recovery machine is started to centrifuge the collected blood, and the red blood cells are washed with physiological saline and then put into a blood transfusion bag for standby use. The suction negative pressure should not exceed $150 mathrm{mmHg}$ to reduce the damage of red blood cells during the collection process. Heparin water is generally prepared by adding 12500 units of heparin to $500 mathrm{ml}$ liquid. Before the operation begins, $50 sim 100 mathrm{ml}$ heparin water is first sucked into the blood storage tank to pre-fill. When sucking blood, the heparin water is fully mixed with the blood at the front end of the absorption circuit to produce an anticoagulant effect. During the operation, the dripping rate of heparin water should be adjusted at any time according to the bleeding rate. The ratio of the amount of heparin water dripped to the amount of blood sucked is generally maintained at $1:5$. If the anticoagulation is insufficient, the blood may coagulate in the pipeline, affecting the quantity and quality of recovered red blood cells. The filter membrane in the blood storage tank can filter out impurities larger than blood cells such as tissue debris and blood clots mixed in the blood. During centrifugal separation, the centrifuge cup rotates at a high speed of $4000 sim 10000 mathrm{r} / mathrm{min}$. The red blood cells are stored at the bottom of the centrifuge cup or close to the cup wall due to the centrifugal effect, while plasma, free hemoglobin, anticoagulants and platelets are diverted to the waste liquid bag. Then, the impurities mixed with the red blood cells are washed out by washing fluid replacement, and the obtained red blood cell suspension (hematocrit is usually $0.45 sim$ 0.65) is stored in the blood transfusion bag for standby use. item Precautions for transfusing recovered blood Recovered blood mainly contains high concentrations of red blood cells, while other components contained in normal blood (such as plasma, platelets, coagulation factors, etc.) are almost completely lost. Therefore, when transfusing a large amount of recovered blood, attention should be paid to appropriately supplementing colloid fluid, FFP and platelets to maintain sufficient blood volume and normal coagulation function in the body. When transfusing a large amount of autologous recovered blood, attention should also be paid to the problem of heparin residue. If necessary, activated coagulation test (ACT) monitoring can be performed. If ACT is significantly prolonged, a small dose of puffer sperm egg (5-10mg) can be used for resistance. Since some free hemoglobin will inevitably remain in the recovered blood, and the red blood cells in the recovered blood will be concentratedly degraded and destroyed in the body over a certain period of time, attention should be paid to monitoring the free hemoglobin in plasma and urine after surgery end{enumerate} {Section 3 Reducing surgical blood loss} Reducing unnecessary bleeding during surgery is an important measure to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion. Clinically, surgeons and anesthesiologists can achieve the goal of reducing blood loss through various means. In recent years, more and more minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and interventional treatment have replaced traditional major trauma surgery, greatly reducing surgical bleeding, and are the future development direction of surgical treatment. {I. Controlled hypotension} Controlled hypotension (see Chapter 7 for details) refers to the use of a variety of methods and drugs to purposefully and controllably reduce the patient's blood pressure to the required level, actively reduce the vascular pressure in the surgical area under the premise of protecting the normal function of various organs and the internal environment, so as to reduce surgical bleeding. Controlled hypotension can not only reduce surgical blood loss and reduce or avoid allogeneic blood transfusion, but also make the surgical field clear, improve surgical accuracy, and speed up the surgical process. The organ's ability to regulate blood flow itself works within a certain range, and the blood pressure range for different organs to regulate blood flow is different. Controlled hypotension is to use the difference in the lower limit of self-regulation between different tissues and organs to achieve the purpose of reducing surgical blood loss. When controlled hypotension causes the mean arterial pressure to be lower than the lowest limit of an organ's ability to regulate blood flow itself, the blood flow of the organ will decrease as the blood pressure further decreases. The operation is mainly performed between the skin and connective tissue. The blood vessels in these parts have limited self-regulatory ability. When MAP is lower than $80 sim 90 mathrm{mmHg}$, the regulatory ability of the blood vessels is basically lost. When the blood pressure is controlled to $50 sim 65 mathrm{mmHg}$, the blood flow in the surgical wound is significantly reduced and the amount of bleeding is reduced. At this time, the blood vessels of important vital organs still have strong self-regulatory ability, which can maintain sufficient tissue perfusion and will not cause organ damage. {II. Intra-abdominal aorta occlusion} Temporarily blocking the blood supply artery in the surgical area during surgery can greatly reduce surgical blood loss. This technology has been widely used in surgery on the distal parts of the upper and lower limbs, such as the tourniquet used in orthopedic or burn plastic surgery. However, since the pelvis, pelvic control, sacrum, lower spine and proximal lower limbs cannot use surface tourniquets, the amount of bleeding in surgery is large and difficult to control. The intra-abdominal aorta balloon occlusion technique with a balloon catheter inserted through the femoral artery can effectively control the bleeding in the above-mentioned surgeries. Ultrasound technology is used to determine the surface landmarks between the right renal artery and the distal end of the abdominal aorta and the bifurcation of the left and right common iliac arteries, and the length of the catheter is estimated; after general anesthesia, the balloon catheter is inserted into the abdominal aorta through femoral artery puncture; and esophageal ultrasound is used to monitor the renal artery blood flow during the operation to ensure the safety of the operation. The balloon is positioned by observing the waveform changes of the $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ of the toes or the arterial pressure in combination with ultrasound technology to includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-190} artificial angiography. After positioning, a pre-occlusion experiment is performed and the angiography is rechecked. It is best if the contrast agent does not flow to the distal end and does not block the blood flow of the bilateral renal arteries. The accurate dose of saline filling the balloon catheter is recorded. The ball is filled before the skin incision. Each filling lasts for $40 sim 60$ minutes. If necessary, blood flow can be restored for $10 sim 15$ minutes between two blockages. The upward movement of the ball blocks the blood flow of both renal arteries, causing acute renal failure, which is the biggest and most serious complication. During the patient's transportation and includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-190(1)}, the common iliac artery is damaged due to the large diameter of the ball and the small inner diameter of the common iliac artery. The position of the catheter ball can be confirmed again by ultrasound after the position is completed. During the operation, urine output must be closely monitored, and attention should be paid to the bleeding in the surgical area and the arterial pulsation of both lower limbs so that new displacement of the ball can be detected in time. After the operation, attention should be paid to pressing and stopping bleeding at the puncture site to avoid the formation of hematoma. The technique of abdominal aorta occlusion with a balloon catheter has the advantages of relatively small trauma, less chance of infection, and convenient intraoperative occlusion and restoration of abdominal aortic blood flow. {III. Rational application of hemostatic agents} {(I) Antifibrinolytic drugs} begin{enumerate} item Synthetic antifibrinolytic drugs end{enumerate} {Chapter 18 Blood protection and rational blood transfusion during the perioperative period} The mechanism of fibrinolysis is mainly to competitively occupy the lysine binding sites on plasminogen and plasmin, blocking the binding of plasminogen to the lysine on fibrin, so that plasmin cannot be formed; even if plasmin is formed, it cannot play a hydrolytic role because it cannot bind to fibrin; large doses can directly inhibit plasmin. In addition, due to the inhibition of plasmin, the generation of fibrin degradation products is reduced, thereby reducing the damage to the number and function of platelets, protecting the platelet receptor GPIb and aggregation function. Commonly used synthetic antifibrinolytic drugs include aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid and aminobenzoic acid. Studies have shown that all three can effectively reduce surgical blood loss. The general dosage of aminocaproic acid is $5 sim 10 mathrm{~g}$ intravenous injection before skin incision, followed by continuous intravenous infusion at a rate of $1 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{h}$ until the end of the operation. The potency of tranexamic acid is $5 sim 10$ times that of aminocaproic acid, and the potency of aminomethylbenzoic acid is $4 sim 5$ times that of aminocaproic acid. Studies have shown that $10 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ intravenous injection of tranexamic acid before skin incision, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of $10 mathrm{mg} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$ can effectively reduce postoperative bleeding in cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor extracted from animal tissues that can inhibit a variety of plasma proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, kininase and coagulation factor XIII. Aprotinin can not only inhibit the activation of the fibrinolytic system, but also protect platelet aggregation; at the same time, it can reduce the consumption of coagulation factors by inhibiting the endogenous coagulation pathway. Aprotinin is very effective in reducing surgical bleeding, often avoiding blood transfusions in more than $50%$ of large operations, and has been widely used. However, the results of a large study in 2006 showed that the risk of postoperative renal failure or stroke was twice as high as that of other drugs when aprotinin was used to stop bleeding during coronary bypass surgery, and the possibility of long-term myocardial infarction or heart failure would increase by $55%$. Later clinical studies confirmed that compared with synthetic antifibrinolytic drugs, the mortality rate of high-risk heart surgery patients who used aprotinin during surgery was significantly increased within 30 days after surgery. Therefore, aprotinin is no longer recommended for perioperative prevention of bleeding in many countries, including China. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(II) Procoagulants} begin{enumerate} item Ethiophenolsulfonamide It can increase the number of platelets and their adhesion function, promote platelets to release coagulation active substances, and accelerate the coagulation process; it can also enhance the resistance of capillaries, reduce their permeability, and prevent blood extravasation. Each intravenous injection of 0.25 to $0.5 mathrm{~g}$ can maintain the effect for $4 sim 5$ hours, and the total daily amount can reach $0.5 sim 1.5 mathrm{~g}$. Ethiophenolsulfonamide acts quickly and has few adverse reactions, but the effect is not very certain. It can be used in combination with other types of hemostatic drugs to enhance its hemostatic effect. item Hemocoagulase It is an enzymatic hemostatic agent extracted from the venom of Brazilian cave snakes, which has a thrombin-like effect. Hemocoagulase can promote platelet aggregation at the site of blood vessel damage, release a series of coagulation factors, promote fibrinogen degradation to generate fibrin, and promote the formation of blood test at the bleeding site; but it has no effect on promoting platelet aggregation in intact blood vessels. Hemocoagulase $1 sim 2$ KU unit (KU) takes effect $5 sim 10$ minutes after intravenous injection, and the drug effect can last for 24 hours. It takes effect $20 sim 30$ minutes after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, and the drug effect lasts for 48 hours. item Prothrombin complex is extracted from human plasma, freeze-dried after virus inactivation, and contains coagulation factors II, VII, IX, $ mathrm{X}$. Prothrombin complex is mainly used for surgical patients with prolonged prothrombin time (PT), reversal of bleeding caused by warfarin, bleeding tendency caused by vitamin $ mathrm{K}$ deficiency, and bleeding caused by insufficient II, VII, IX and X factors due to impaired liver function. The conventional dosage is $10 sim 20$ plasma units $( mathrm{PE}) / mathrm{kg}$, and each plasma unit is equivalent to the content of coagulation factors in $1 mathrm{ml}$ fresh frozen plasma. In case of heavy bleeding or major surgery, the dosage can be appropriately increased according to the condition. item Freeze-dried human fibrinogen is separated and purified from healthy human plasma, and freeze-dried after virus inactivation. After entering the human body, it can be converted into insoluble fibrin under the action of thrombin to stop bleeding. It is mainly used for major surgical operations, trauma or visceral bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, etc. Dissolve it with $30^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ injection water before infusion, and use it immediately after dissolution. When infusing, a blood transfusion set with a filter must be used, and the drip rate should not exceed $40 sim 60$ drops/minute. The infusion should be completed within 2 hours, and the daily dosage is $3 sim 8 mathrm{~g}$. Item Lyophilized Human Coagulation Factor VIII mainly contains the $ mathbb{I}$ coagulation factor and a small amount of fibrinogen. Factor VIII is mainly used to treat hemophilia A and is the primary measure to prevent surgical and traumatic bleeding in patients with congenital factor VIII deficiency. Intravenous injection of $1 mathrm{IU} / mathrm{kg}$ can increase plasma factor VIII activity by $2 %$. When preventing surgical bleeding, $40 sim 50 mathrm{IU} / mathrm{kg}$ can be infused 1 hour before surgery. Dissolve it in $25 sim 30^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ injection water before use and infuse it within 20 minutes. Pulmonary edema may occur when infused in large doses, so patients with heart disease should be careful. In addition, the preparation has not been treated with virus inactivation and there is a risk of transmitting hepatitis and AIDS. Item Recombinant Factor VII Activator is a new type of hemostatic drug that may have a significant effect on difficult hemostasis in extracorporeal circulation, liver transplantation and other major surgeries. It can act directly on the bleeding site, combine with local tissue factor $( mathrm{TF})$ to form a $ mathrm{VII} mathrm{a} / mathrm{TF}$ complex, and further activate factor X in the common coagulation pathway and factor IX in the intrinsic pathway, increasing the production of local thrombin; it can also enhance platelet function through different mechanisms. This drug is artificially recombinantly synthesized and has no risk of transmitting viruses; it does not activate the systemic coagulation system and rarely causes complications of hypercoagulability. item Locally applied hemostatic drugs or hemostatic materials In addition to using coagulation drugs by intravenous or intramuscular injection, surgeons can also use local hemostatic drugs or hemostatic materials directly on the bleeding site during surgery. Currently, thrombin, absorbent gelatin sponge, medical biological gelatin and hemostatic gauze are widely used, all of which can achieve a certain effect of reducing surgical bleeding. end{enumerate} {IV. Minimally Invasive Surgery} Minimally invasive surgery is a branch of medicine that uses tiny incisions or normal human orifices to deliver special instruments, physical energy or chemical agents into the human body to inactivate, remove, repair or reconstruct lesions and physical injuries in the body to achieve the goal of treatment. With the continuous invention and improvement of minimally invasive surgical instruments, as well as the promotion of minimally invasive concepts and operation techniques, minimally invasive surgery has involved almost all traditional surgical fields. Minimally invasive surgical technology not only significantly reduces patient trauma and pain and shortens the treatment cycle due to its greater precision, but also significantly reduces perioperative blood loss, allowing those who originally had to face a large amount of blood loss and the risk of blood transfusion due to traditional surgery to successfully complete treatment with less bleeding, less blood transfusion or even no blood transfusion. (Liu Jin and Liu Guangyue) {Chapter 19 Shock} {Section 1 Overview} {I. Concepts} Shock refers to a clinical syndrome characterized by abnormal cell metabolism, organ dysfunction and even failure, which is caused by the body being attacked by various causes, resulting in insufficient blood perfusion to the tissues, which leads to the inability of tissue oxygen supply to meet the needs of cell metabolism. Although the occurrence and development of various types of shock have different causes and courses, the common pathophysiological changes of shock are insufficient blood perfusion to the tissues, abnormal cell metabolism and organ dysfunction. If this pathophysiological state is not corrected in time, the patient may die from multiple organ dysfunction or failure. {II. Classification of shock} According to the causes and pathophysiological characteristics of shock, shock can be classified into: begin{enumerate} item Hypovolemic shock Due to the acute reduction of systemic blood volume, the effective circulating blood volume is absolutely insufficient, resulting in insufficient tissue perfusion and systemic ischemia and hypoxia. Hemorrhagic shock refers to the shock caused by a large amount of blood loss and a decrease in intravascular volume; traumatic shock refers to the shock caused by a large amount of intravascular fluid loss and other stress reactions after severe trauma or burns. item Septic shock refers to the systemic infection of the body after being invaded by pathogens, which causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome and hemodynamic disorders such as hypotension, resulting in insufficient tissue perfusion and systemic ischemia and hypoxia. item Cardiogenic shock refers to the dysfunction or failure of the heart caused by heart disease itself or mechanical factors, which leads to a sharp decrease in cardiac output, insufficient tissue perfusion and systemic ischemia and hypoxia. For example, in acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, postoperative heart surgery and cardiac trauma, due to insufficient heart blood function, the perfusion of the whole body tissues (including the myocardium) is insufficient, and insufficient coronary perfusion can inhibit heart function, forming a vicious cycle. item Neurogenic shock (neurogenic shock) Due to nerve damage or paralysis, the blood vessels in the area innervated by the nerve lose nerve control, resulting in reduced vascular resistance and vasodilation, imbalance in the ratio of vascular bed volume and blood volume, reduced cardiac output and hypotension, insufficient tissue perfusion and hypoxia, which is called neurogenic shock. item Anaphylactic shock (anaphylactic shock) The sensitized body produces an acute, systemic, and strong type I allergic reaction to antigenic substances, causing acute respiratory and circulatory failure, which is called anaphylactic shock. After the antibody reacts with the antigen, the body's mast cells can release a large amount of biologically active substances, such as histamine and peptides, which can cause sudden expansion of blood vessels, increased capillary permeability, a sudden drop in blood pressure, insufficient tissue perfusion and hypoxia, and in severe cases, it can lead to sudden death of the patient. end{enumerate} {III. Pathophysiological changes} Although the causes of various types of shock are different, the common pathophysiological changes of shock are the excitement of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system, which causes the microcirculation of important organs in the body to be in a low perfusion state, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Continuous insufficient nutrient supply leads to extensive cellular deficiency and biochemical metabolic disorders, and rapidly progresses to irreversible cell necrosis, organ dysfunction, and even multiple organ failure until death. From a physiological point of view, the capillary-cell junction is the main site for the body to transport oxygen and nutrients to human tissues and excrete metabolic products in the body. Regardless of the type of shock, it can cause microcirculatory perfusion disorders, leading to \"generalized ischemic hypoxia\" in the whole body tissues. As a result, the energy metabolism of cells is impaired, the available energy supply is reduced, the cell's oxygen uptake and utilization are impaired, and ultimately lead to organ dysfunction or failure. The pathophysiological changes of shock include: changes in microcirculation, changes in humoral factors, changes in metabolism, cell damage and oxygen dynamics, changes in the blood system, and dysfunction of important organs. {(I) Changes in microcirculation} Microcirculation refers to the blood circulation of microvessels between arterioles and venules. It is the smallest functional unit for the metabolic exchange of substances between blood and tissues and is mainly regulated by neurohumoral factors. In the early stage of shock, due to the decrease in effective blood volume, arterial blood pressure drops, tissue perfusion decreases, and cells are hypoxic. At this time, the body regulates and corrects the pathophysiological changes that have occurred through a series of compensatory mechanisms, including: vasomotor center pressor reflexes caused by pressure receptors located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, Sympathetic-adrenal axis excitation leads to the release of large black catecholamines and increased secretion of renin-angiotensin, which increases heart rate and cardiac output. At the same time, by selectively contracting small blood vessels in the periphery (skin, skeletal muscle) and viscera (such as liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract), the circulating blood volume is redistributed to ensure the perfusion of important organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, so that the blood supply to these important organs remains basically normal when the systemic circulating blood volume is reduced. At this time, if the cause can be removed, shock is easier to correct. As the lesion continues to progress, the arteriovenous shunt is further opened, the original tissue hypoxia becomes more serious, and cellular hypoxia leads to increased anaerobic metabolism, insufficient energy production, accumulation of lactic acid products, and release of vasodilators (such as histamine and bradykinin). These substances can directly cause the precapillary sphincter to relax, and the sphincter is still in a contracted state due to its low sensitivity to them, resulting in increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, blood retention, increased vascular permeability, and plasma extravasation. Blood stagnates in the intestines, liver, lungs and other internal organs. This leads to a decrease in the amount of blood returning to the heart, a sharp decrease in effective circulating blood, a decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure, and insufficient perfusion of organs such as the heart and brain. At this time, the microcirculation is characterized by extensive dilation of microvessels. The patient's clinical manifestations are progressive hypotension. When the mean arterial pressure is $<55 mathrm{mmHg}$, the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems lose their own regulation, the coronary arteries and cerebral vessels are insufficiently perfused, and the mind changes from indifference to confusion or even coma; the pulse is weak and fast, the veins collapse, the skin becomes cyanotic and mottled; the renal blood flow is severely insufficient, and oliguria or even anuria occurs; tissue hypoperfusion and cell metabolism disorders cause acidosis, which further aggravates the dysfunction of the cardiovascular system. If the disease continues to develop, it will enter the late stage of shock, at which point the disease is serious and irreversible. The viscous blood stagnating in the microcirculation is in a hypercoagulable state in an acidic environment, and red blood cells and platelets are prone to aggregation and form microthrombi in blood vessels, and even cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), At the same time, due to severe tissue perfusion deficiency, cell hypoxia and insufficient energy supply, the lysosomal membrane in the cell may rupture and various acid hydrolases may overflow, causing cell autolysis, and eventually resulting in large tissues and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or failure. {(II) Changes in humoral factors} When the body is hit by any serious harmful stimulus, the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and glucocorticoid in the blood increase, and a series of systemic reactions are induced to resist the harmful stimulus and maintain physiological functions, namely the stress response. The stress response is a double-edged sword. A moderate stress response is conducive to maintaining the stability of the internal environment and the repair of tissues, but if the stress is excessive, it may lead to self-damage. For example, during the occurrence of shock, trauma, hypoxia or bacterial infection may cause the body to release many neurohumoral factors, such as catecholamines, angiotensin-angiotensin, antidiuretic hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, growth hormone, etc. The release of humoral factors plays a certain protective role on the body. It can increase heart rate and myocardial contractility to increase cardiac output; produce systemic vascular contraction to ensure perfusion of vital organs; retain water and sodium to maintain effective circulating blood volume; mobilize the raw materials needed for body metabolism, such as glucose and fat, to produce enough energy to meet the needs of the body. Recent studies have shown that the reason why shock or infection can cause functional changes in other organs is that the severe damage to the body caused by these diseases can cause inflammatory cell activation and the release of a large number of inflammatory mediators, leading to a strong systemic inflammatory response, which in turn affects the extensive damage and functional changes of organs in various systems throughout the body. The main inflammatory mediators include: tumor necrosis factor-$ alpha$ (TNF-$ alpha$), interleukins (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, etc.), hematoxylin, prostaglandins, myocardial inhibitors, etc.\n",
      "{(III) Metabolic changes} Sugar metabolism disorders cause cellular energy crisis. Under physiological conditions, cells, organs and human functions all depend on the continuous use of cells includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-194} , which is first oxidized and dehydroxylated to become acetyl coenzyme $ mathrm{A}$; then it enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is further oxidized to $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water, and produces 38 ATP molecules, which can provide $ mathrm{~kJ}$ of heat. However, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate can only be reduced to lactate, producing 2 ATP molecules, providing $ mathrm{~kJ}$ of heat, which is only $ 6.9 % $ of aerobic metabolism, causing cellular energy crisis. Metabolic changes during shock include: increased protein breakdown and gluconeogenesis; accelerated glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle and liver; increased anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production during hypoxia, coupled with impaired liver metabolism of lactic acid, which causes lactic acid accumulation and leads to metabolic acidosis. Tissue hypoxia, insufficient energy synthesis, and accumulation of metabolites can all cause dysfunction of cell membrane ion pumps, leading to severe damage to vulnerable organ cells and even death (necrosis or apoptosis). {IV) Cell damage and changes in oxygen dynamics} Cell damage in shock depends on the duration and severity of shock. Under anaerobic metabolism, ATP synthesis is reduced and continuously consumed, which impairs the function of cell membrane $ mathrm{Na}^{+}- mathrm{K}^{+}-ATP$ enzyme, causing cell edema and hyperkalemia, cell membrane damage, and a significant decrease in transmembrane potential; intracellular lactic acid, hydrogen ions, and inorganic phosphates accumulate, and perfusion disorders and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ cannot be removed in time, causing and aggravating local acidosis; mitochondrial swelling and destruction cause respiratory chain disorders and further reduce energy substances; the increase of intracellular tantalum also exacerbates the depletion of ATP reserves. At the same time, ischemic organs such as the intestine, liver, and pancreas release lysosomal enzymes, causing cell autolysis, basement membrane damage, activation of the kinin system, and the formation of toxic peptides such as myocardial depressant factor (MDF). MDF reduces myocardial contractility and causes abdominal visceral vasoconstriction, thereby aggravating circulatory disorders. Its non-enzymatic components can also cause mast cell degranulation, release histamine, increase capillary permeability and attract leukocytes, aggravating the pathological process of shock. Excessive production of certain inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1, IL-6, etc.), imbalance of anti-inflammatory mediator homeostasis, oxygen free radicals released during respiratory burst and ischemia-reperfusion, NO, PAF, PGs and LTs produced by lysosomal enzyme stimulation can all lead to cell damage. When microcirculatory disorders and cell damage reach a certain extent, tissue oxygen utilization disorders and tissue cell hypoxia occur, that is, oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$ is often higher than normal, while oxygen consumption $ left( mathrm{VO}_{2} right)$ is lower than normal. Clinically, it can be seen that the mixed venous oxygen partial pressure $ left( mathrm{PvO}_{2} right)$ increases, the arteriovenous oxygen content difference $ left( mathrm{CaO}_{2}- mathrm{CvO}_{2} right)$ decreases, and the lactic acid in the blood further increases. At this time, the oxygen deficit increases, and the oxygen debt accumulated by the oxygen deficit over a certain period of time also gradually increases. This pathophysiological feature is more common in septic shock. {(V) Changes in the blood system} Long-term ischemia, hypoxia, acidosis, endotoxins and other factors damage the vascular endothelium, expose collagen, and activate the endogenous coagulation system. At the same time, tissue cell damage releases a large amount of tissue factor into the blood, thereby activating the exogenous coagulation system. During shock, the blood is concentrated, the blood viscosity and fibrinogen increase, red blood cells and platelets are easy to aggregate, the blood is in a hypercoagulable state, and the blood flow rate slows down significantly, leading to microthrombosis. During shock, neutrophils can also be activated by hypoxia, acidosis, and endotoxins, producing a large amount of procoagulant substances. Later, due to the exhaustion of coagulation factors, fibrinolysis proceeds, forming disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Although DIC is not a necessary process of shock, once it occurs, it will worsen the condition. Microcirculatory blockage and bleeding cause a sharp decrease in the amount of blood returning to the heart. When fibrinolysis proceeds, fibrin degradation products (FDP) and certain complement components increase vascular permeability. {(VI) Dysfunction of important organs} During shock, circulatory disorders cause cell ischemia and hypoxia, and cell function changes significantly, leading to organ dysfunction. When any organ is underperfused, its function can be damaged to varying degrees. Long-term low perfusion can lead to irreversible damage to organ function. begin{enumerate} item Heart Due to insufficient effective circulating blood volume, the amount of blood returning to the heart is reduced, and the excitability of the sympathetic nervous system is increased, which can increase the heart rate, increase the myocardial contractility, and increase the compensatory cardiac output. If the shock continues to develop, it can lead to insufficient coronary perfusion and the release of myocardial inhibitory factors, which can severely inhibit the myocardial contractility. Severe myocardial ischemia can lead to subendocardial or myocardial infarction and severe arrhythmias. item Brain Due to the release of catecholamines caused by stress response, the central nervous system is excited. With the further reduction of cerebral blood flow, brain function can be progressively damaged. Ultimately, brain cell ischemia can lead to increased local lactic acid, brain cell edema, cell membrane structure destruction, loss of neurotransmission function and irreversible brain damage. Patients show restlessness, apathy, and coma. Brainstem damage can cause respiratory and circulatory failure. item Lungs Insufficient circulating blood volume can reduce pulmonary circulation perfusion and increase the number of alveoli with ventilation but no perfusion. As a result, the ineffective alveolar ventilation increases, the gas exchange function is seriously impaired, and hypoxemia and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulation may occur. Long-term pulmonary circulation hypoperfusion and hypoxia may promote the formation of microthrombosis in pulmonary capillaries, and may damage capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in further damage to alveolar perfusion, increased pulmonary capillary permeability and pulmonary interstitial edema, and reduced production of alveolar surfactant. In severe cases, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur. Item Kidney When hypovolemia causes a decrease in cardiac output, the kidneys also undergo compensatory functional changes, which are manifested as decreased renal blood flow, decreased glomerular filtration rate, increased secretion of aldosteron and antidiuretic hormone to increase the reabsorption of sodium and water by the kidneys. As a result, urine concentration, decreased urine volume and decreased urine sodium content may occur. If not corrected in time, it may lead to renal tubular necrosis, and in severe cases, renal cortical necrosis and irreversible acute renal failure may occur. In septic shock or traumatic shock, in addition to insufficient renal perfusion, there is often damage to the renal tubules by toxic metabolites, leading to acute renal failure. Item Liver Decreased liver blood flow can cause ischemia and hypoxia of liver cells, leading to metabolic dysfunction of the liver. In the early stage, accelerated liver glycogen degradation and glycogen metabolism can cause elevated blood sugar. However, in the late stage, due to impaired carbohydrate uptake and increased glycogen consumption, hypoglycemia can occur. Due to increased protein and fat metabolism, the liver's ability to metabolize lactic acid is reduced, resulting in aggravation of existing metabolic lactic acidosis or acidosis. The liver's ability to metabolize bilirubin, bacterial toxins and metabolites (such as arsenic) is reduced, and the detoxification function of liver cells is also impaired, resulting in liver failure. item Gastrointestinal tract When the effective blood volume of the whole body is insufficient and the tissue perfusion pressure is significantly reduced, in order to ensure the blood perfusion of important vital organs (such as the heart and brain), the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal tract, skin and skeletal muscles first undergo compensatory contraction, and the vascular resistance increases significantly, causing the gastrointestinal tract to be in an ischemic and hypoxic state. As a result, the barrier function of the mucosal epithelial cells is damaged, causing bacteria or toxins in the intestine to enter the blood circulation; the gastrointestinal motility function is reduced, resulting in intestinal paralysis; severe mucosal ischemia can lead to gastrointestinal ulcers; damage to the gastrointestinal tract's absorption function of carbohydrates and proteins; pancreatic ischemia can also release myocardial inhibitory factors and damage myocardial function. end{enumerate} {IV. Clinical manifestations and stages of shock} Although different types of shock have their own characteristics in clinical manifestations, the development of shock has a common process. According to the development process of shock, shock can be divided into the following three stages. {(I) Compensatory shock stage} Also known as the pre-shock stage. During this period, patients often show mental excitement or irritability, and the body undergoes compensatory changes to ensure blood perfusion and oxygen supply to vital organs (heart, brain, etc.). begin{enumerate} item Increased heart rate and enhanced myocardial contractility Shock can cause the body's stress response and the release of catecholamines, leading to increased heart rate and enhanced myocardial contractility, increasing cardiac output (CO), which is beneficial to maintaining arterial blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Although blood pressure can still be maintained at a normal to low level, the stroke volume (SV) decreases and the pulse pressure becomes narrower. item Systemic venous constriction It can increase the amount of blood returning to the heart, increase cardiac filling pressure and stroke volume. However, patients show pale complexion and collapse of superficial veins. item Systemic arterial constriction It can increase peripheral resistance and help maintain blood pressure. In the compensatory stage of shock, it is mainly the arteries of the skin, internal organs and skeletal muscles that constrict to ensure blood perfusion of vital organs such as the heart and brain. Clinically, it manifests as pale complexion and skin, cold and wet limbs; gastrointestinal dysfunction, and even stress ulcers; decreased urine output, often less than $0.5 sim 1 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$. Changes in item microcirculation Contraction of precapillary sphincters and arterioles can reduce the perfusion of the capillary network, reduce the blood flow of the capillary network, reduce hydrostatic pressure, and promote the transfer of extravascular fluid to the blood vessels. When acute blood loss of $1500 mathrm{ml}$ occurs within 1 hour, about $400 sim 600 mathrm{ml}$ of body fluid will transfer from the interstitial tissue to the blood vessels, which can partially supplement the lack of intravascular volume. The increase in intravascular volume can also increase the amount of venous return to the heart, increase cardiac output, and increase blood pressure. If blood loss continues, the extravascular fluid reserve may also be exhausted, which is manifested clinically as loss of skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, and oliguria. Since non-vital organ tissue accounts for about $75%$ of the body, insufficient tissue perfusion and anaerobic metabolism in a large area can cause increased blood lactate and metabolic acidosis. end{enumerate} {(II) Shock phase} When shock continues to develop, the above compensatory mechanisms are not enough to maintain hemodynamic stability and perfusion of vital organs, and clinical manifestations are hypotension, which is called the shock phase. At this time, the blood flow of vital organs is also significantly reduced, and clinical signs and symptoms of central nervous system and myocardial ischemia may appear, such as apathy, arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia and ST-T changes, and peripheral pulses weaken or even disappear, indicating that cardiac output is severely reduced. Due to the high excitement of the sympathetic nervous system, blood vessels are severely contracted, the skin becomes paler and colder, the mucous membranes and nail beds become gray, and urine volume decreases progressively. The degree of tissue hypoperfusion becomes more serious, lactic acid production increases, and metabolic acidosis continues to worsen. Since venous smooth muscle can tolerate local tissue hypoxia and acidosis better than arterial smooth muscle, the precapillary sphincter begins to relax, while the postcapillary venous system remains in a contracted state. In this way, the blood flow into the capillary network exceeds the outflow, causing a large amount of blood to be retained, resulting in a significant increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries. In addition, the permeability of the capillary wall increases due to ischemia, and a large amount of body fluid passes through the capillary wall into the tissue interstitium, which further worsens the existing hypovolemia, greatly reduces the effective circulating blood volume, and reduces blood pressure. If the primary disease or injury is not treated quickly and effectively, it will enter the irreversible shock stage. {(III) Late stage of shock} Severe or prolonged systemic tissue hypoxia can reduce the sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to catecholamines, making blood pressure difficult to maintain; hypotension further aggravates tissue hypoxia, forming a vicious cycle. Due to severe systemic tissue hypoperfusion, the physiological function of the circulatory system is further damaged. The most serious is the increase in capillary permeability, which leads to severe fluid leakage. At this time, any fluid injected will quickly leak into the interstitial space. Secondly, both arteries and veins will dilate passively, and the capacity of the vascular bed will significantly expand, causing some body fluid to remain in the peripheral circulation. Even if a large amount of fluid is injected quickly, due to the severe leakage of capillaries and the retention of fluid in peripheral blood vessels, the amount of blood returning to the heart and the effective circulating blood volume will drop sharply, and the cardiac output will drop to an unacceptable level. If the systemic condition continues to deteriorate and does not respond to conventional anti-shock measures, there will be a high mortality rate. Because shock essentially involves varying degrees of tissue and organ ischemia, if treatment is delayed or improperly treated, it can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury, and further development can lead to serious damage to organ function. Due to the increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries, fluid and even plasma proteins can leak into the pulmonary interstitium, causing pulmonary interstitial edema, reduced lung compliance and gas diffusion dysfunction; renal tubular ischemia and necrosis, oliguria or anuria, and no response to infusion or diuretics; gastrointestinal tract mucosa ischemia, necrosis and ulceration, loss of its barrier function, resulting in the entry of bacteria or toxins in the interstitium and intestines into the blood circulation, which can develop into sepsis; myocardial contractility is also reduced due to hypoperfusion, eventually leading to heart failure. The lactate concentration in arterial blood can reflect the degree of systemic anaerobic metabolism and hypoperfusion. If the lactate concentration increases from the normal $1 sim 2 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ to $5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ or more and is accompanied by severe and difficult-to-correct acidosis, the patient's survival rate is significantly reduced. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or multiple organ failure (MOF) is often the main cause of death in patients in the late stage of shock. {V. Clinical monitoring of shock}\n",
      "{(I) General clinical observation and monitoring} begin{enumerate} item Mental status mainly reflects the blood perfusion and oxygen supply of brain tissue. In the process of gradual decrease of cerebral blood perfusion, the degree of cerebral hypoxia continues to increase, and the patient may successively show symptoms such as excitement, restlessness, apathy, coma, etc. Infection, poisoning and metabolic disorders can also cause changes in consciousness. item Skin temperature and color In shock, due to compensatory contraction of blood vessels in the skin and mucous membranes, blood perfusion is insufficient, and the body surface temperature decreases; sympathetic nerve excitement promotes vasoconstriction and increased sweat gland secretion, the color of the skin and mucous membranes becomes pale or gray, and the skin becomes damp and cold. Therefore, the temperature and color of the skin can reflect the perfusion of the body surface tissue. When the skin temperature changes from cold to warm and the color changes from pale to ruddy, it means that the blood circulation of the tissue has improved. item Urine volume and specific gravity The amount of urine can directly reflect the perfusion of the kidneys and is also a window for measuring the perfusion of the whole body tissue. Generally speaking, urine volume decreases during the compensatory phase of shock. Continued decrease in urine volume indicates that organ perfusion insufficiency has not been corrected. Increased urine volume after treatment indicates improved organ perfusion. Decreased urine volume and increased urine specific gravity indicate insufficient blood volume and no significant damage to renal function. However, during the polyuric phase of renal failure or non-oliguric renal failure, urine volume increases abnormally, but urine specific gravity decreases and remains unchanged. item Blood pressure Maintaining a stable blood pressure is very important in shock treatment. However, blood pressure is not the most sensitive indicator of the degree of shock. When cardiac output has not yet fully recovered, blood pressure may have returned to normal. Therefore, when judging the condition, other parameters should also be considered for comprehensive analysis. It is generally believed that systolic blood pressure $<90 mathrm{mmHg}$ and pulse pressure $<20 mathrm{mmHg}$ are evidence of shock, while blood pressure recovery and increased pulse pressure are signs of improvement in shock. item Pulse rate Changes in pulse rate often occur before changes in blood pressure. When the pulse rate has recovered and the limbs are warm, although the blood pressure is still low, it means that the shock may have improved. The shock index is usually calculated by pulse rate/systolic blood pressure (mmHg) to determine the degree of shock. An index of $1.0 sim 1.5$ indicates the presence of shock; >2.0 indicates severe shock. end{enumerate} {(II) Hemodynamic monitoring} In addition to continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring during shock, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary dwarf pressure, cardiac output and cardiac index can also be monitored. For details, see Chapter 15. {(III) Monitoring of oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$ and oxygen consumption $ left( mathrm{VO}_{2} right)$} The changes in oxygen supply and oxygen consumption during shock and their relationship are increasingly valued. Oxygen supply refers to the total amount of oxygen delivered to the body's tissues by the circulatory system per unit time. Oxygen consumption refers to the total amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues per unit time. Oxygen uptake rate is the ratio of oxygen consumption to oxygen supply. It is the percentage of oxygen taken from arterial blood at the tissue capillaries, reflecting the utilization of oxygen in the whole body. The above parameters can be calculated by formula. Monitoring and regulating oxygen supply and consumption are of great significance for guiding the treatment of shock patients and reducing the mortality rate of severe shock. {(IV) Laboratory blank inspection} begin{enumerate} item Arterial blood gas analysis The main function of respiration is to provide cells with sufficient oxygen and discharge $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Blood gas analysis not only helps to judge respiratory function and acid-base balance, but also is an important indicator for judging whether the condition is improving or worsening. It should be checked regularly according to the condition. item Detection of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) For cases suspected of DIC, platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, etc. should be tested. If necessary, D-dimer (D-dimer), fibrin degradation products (FDP), etc. can be checked. item Determination of blood lactate content During shock, oxygen demand increases, while tissue perfusion and oxygen supply are insufficient, resulting in increased anaerobic metabolism and increased blood lactate content. Therefore, monitoring plasma lactate content can reflect the severity of tissue ischemia and is also an important indicator for measuring the effectiveness of shock treatment. The normal value is $1 sim 1.5 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. item Monitoring of gastric mucosa $ mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{pH}( mathrm{pHi})$ The gastrointestinal mucosa is the first tissue to be damaged by tissue ischemia and hypoxia during shock. The gastric mucosa $ mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{pH}$ are good indicators for measuring the blood perfusion status and oxygen supply of the internal organs. The normal value range of $ mathrm{pHi}$ is $7.35 sim 7.45$. A value below 7.30 often reflects that the internal organs are in a state of low perfusion. item Monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$ and central venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{ScvO}_{2} right)$ $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is an important parameter reflecting tissue oxygen balance, which can reflect both oxygenation function and changes in circulatory function. $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ needs to be measured by taking pulmonary artery blood through a pulmonary artery catheter. The $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ of a healthy person is $73% sim 85%$. $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is measured by taking a sample of blood from the superior vena cava. $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ is one of the important monitoring indicators for severe infection and septic shock, and can detect changes in the condition earlier. $ mathrm{ScVO}_{2}$ has a good correlation with $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$, is more operational in clinical practice, and can reflect the state of tissue perfusion. In patients with severe infection and septic shock, $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}<60%$, or $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}<70%$ indicates a significant increase in mortality. end{enumerate} {Six, basic principles of shock treatment} Although shock caused by different reasons has its own particularity in treatment, in addition to treating the cause, the basic principles of other treatments are consistent. The main purpose of shock treatment is to quickly restore blood perfusion and oxygen supply to tissues and organs. To achieve this goal: (1) First, the volume should be fully supplemented to achieve the ideal cardiac filling pressure and increase the effective circulating blood volume; (2) In order to maintain tissue perfusion, vasoactive drugs should be used reasonably to maintain appropriate perfusion pressure; (3) Positive inotropic drugs should be used to improve cardiac function and increase cardiac output; (4) Strengthen respiratory management and treatment to improve lung ventilation and oxygenation function. {(I) Supplementing blood volume} The function of blood circulation is to supply the body with oxygen and energy required for metabolism and to excrete metabolic products. The so-called circulatory failure does not refer to some clinical manifestations secondary to shock, but to insufficient tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Therefore, the primary treatment method is to fully supplement blood volume to achieve the ideal cardiac filling pressure and increase the effective circulating blood volume. The effects of fluid therapy include: (1) Increasing cardiac preload to increase cardiac output. According to the Frank-Starling curve, when the end-diastolic volume of the heart gradually increases from a low level, the stroke volume and cardiac output also gradually increase; but when it reaches a certain level (i.e., the curve plateau level), the end-diastolic volume continues to increase, while the stroke volume and cardiac output decrease instead. Therefore, fluid therapy should achieve the ideal cardiac filling pressure. (2) Increase oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$. $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$ is the product of cardiac output and arterial oxygen content $ left( mathrm{CaO}_{2} right)$. Increasing cardiac output can increase $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$. The amount of fluid infusion should be evaluated based on the cause, hemodynamic parameters, urine output, and oxygenation indicators. Rivers proposed that the volume resuscitation target for septic shock within 6 hours of onset is: central venous pressure $($ CVP $)>8 sim 12 mathrm{mmHg}$, mean arterial pressure $($ MAP $)>$ $65 sim 90 mathrm{mmHg}$, urine output $>0.5 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$, mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)>65 %$ or central venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{ScvO}_{2} right)>70 %$. Resuscitation according to the above standards can significantly improve the survival rate of patients with septic shock. Crystalloids, colloids or blood products should be selected according to the condition. It is generally believed that rapid infusion of colloids is more likely to restore blood volume and maintain hemodynamic stability and colloid osmotic pressure. If the hemoglobin $(mathrm{Hb})$ is greater than $100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, red blood cell transfusion is not necessary; if it is less than $70 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, concentrated red blood cells should be transfused to maintain $mathrm{Hb}$ at $100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ or Hct at $30%$; between $70 sim 100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, the decision is based on the patient's compensatory ability, general condition, and other organ lesions; when the amount of blood loss is too large, fresh plasma and coagulation factors should be appropriately supplemented to correct coagulation abnormalities. {(II) Correcting acid-base imbalance} During shock, due to insufficient tissue perfusion and hypoxia, anaerobic metabolism increases, and metabolic products such as lactic acid and pyruvic acid accumulate, leading to metabolic acidosis. In the early stage of shock, acidosis is generally not corrected with drugs. After volume resuscitation to improve tissue perfusion, acidosis can usually be corrected on its own. When $ mathrm{pH}$ is lower than 7.20, myocardial contractility can be weakened, sensitivity to sympathomimetic amines can be reduced, and the treatment effect can be affected. It can also lower the threshold of ventricular fibrillation and lead to refractory ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, severe acidosis should be corrected with drugs. Commonly used drugs are sodium bicarbonate. It is best to guide the use of alkaline drugs based on the results of arterial blood gas analysis. The dosage of sodium bicarbonate can be estimated according to the following formula: [ text { sodium bicarbonate }( mathrm{mmol})= operatorname{SBE} times text { body weight }( mathrm{kg}) times 2 ] Generally, half of the dose is intravenously infused first, and after observing clinical manifestations and checking blood gas analysis, it is decided whether to continue the medication.\n",
      "{(III) Application of cardiovascular active drugs} The blood perfusion of tissues and organs depends on two factors: perfusion pressure and vascular caliber. Therefore, in the treatment of shock, it is important to pay attention to maintaining blood pressure while avoiding excessive contraction of peripheral blood vessels. Otherwise, although blood pressure can be increased, blood perfusion of tissues will be reduced; when blood pressure is too low, tissue perfusion pressure is insufficient and blood perfusion will also be reduced. In order to maintain the minimum tissue perfusion pressure, especially to ensure perfusion of important organs, vasoconstrictors can be appropriately used while rapidly infusing fluids to increase blood pressure more quickly. Vasoconstrictors cannot replace volume resuscitation, and conditions should be created as soon as possible to reduce or withdraw them. If peripheral vascular resistance increases significantly, appropriate vasodilators should be used. Commonly used vasoactive drugs include: begin{enumerate} item Dopamine is the first choice drug, which can excite dopamine receptors and $ alpha, beta$ adrenergic receptors. When the dosage is $0.5 sim 3 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, it mainly activates dopamine receptors, dilates kidney and visceral blood vessels, and is beneficial to organ perfusion; when the dosage is $4 sim 10 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, it can increase myocardial contractility, heart rate and cardiac output; when the dosage is $10 sim 20 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, it mainly excites $ alpha$ receptors, increasing vascular resistance. When the dosage is greater than $15 sim 20 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, if blood pressure is still low or tachycardia occurs, potent vasoconstrictors such as norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and epinephrine can be used. item Norepinephrine is often used for those who have difficulty maintaining blood pressure with dopamine alone. Its strong $ alpha$ receptor stimulating effect can often correct vasodilation during septic shock, slow heart rate, and increase cardiac output and urine volume. The dosage for adults starts from 0. $05 sim 0.1 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, and is gradually adjusted to maintain stable blood pressure. However, excessive dosage of norepinephrine and prolonged use may damage renal perfusion. Therefore, clinically, small doses of dopamine and norepinephrine are often used together, which is beneficial to renal perfusion and can achieve the purpose of maintaining blood pressure. item Dobutamine This drug is one of the commonly used drugs for the treatment of shock, especially septic shock. It has the effect of directly stimulating $ beta$ receptors (mainly $ beta$, receptors) and $ alpha$ receptors, but does not stimulate dopamine receptors. Therefore, it can directly excite the myocardium and improve myocardial contractility, thereby increasing stroke volume and cardiac output without significantly accelerating the heart rate. It is mainly used to treat cardiac dysfunction caused by congestive heart failure, cardiogenic or septic shock. The dosage is $2.5 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$, and the maximum dosage should not exceed $20 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$. end{enumerate} (IV) Respiratory management and oxygen therapy Respiratory management is very important in the treatment of shock. In addition to restoring effective blood volume, increasing arterial blood oxygen content $ left( mathrm{CaO}_{2} right)$ is very important in the treatment of shock. In order to increase $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$, hypoxemia should be avoided and corrected, and $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ should be maintained at $ mathrm{mmHg} and $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ at $ 95 % sim 99 %$. Respiratory management includes oxygen therapy, positive airway pressure therapy, mechanical ventilation therapy, chest physical therapy, airway warming and humidification therapy, etc. Generally speaking, patients with shock need oxygen therapy because the tissue oxygen requirement increases significantly during shock, often twice that of normal people. For patients with combined respiratory dysfunction, in addition to appropriately increasing the concentration of inhaled oxygen, positive airway pressure therapy can be applied. Positive airway pressure therapy is mainly suitable for patients with varying degrees of hypoxemia caused by a significant decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC). Whether they are breathing spontaneously or mechanically ventilated, positive airway pressure therapy should be considered. For patients with severe shock or combined respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation should be performed as soon as possible to ensure the patency of the airway, alveolar ventilation function and adequate oxygen supply. If necessary, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be applied. Mechanical ventilation can also reduce the work of breathing and reduce the oxygen consumption of the whole body. {Section 2 Hypovolemic Shock} {I. Causes} {(I) Extracorporeal loss of body fluids} begin{enumerate} item Blood loss Including trauma, surgery, hemoptysis, hematemesis, blood in the stool, peripartum uterine bleeding, etc. item Loss through the digestive tract Such as vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal fistula, etc. item Loss of body fluids through the kidneys Such as diabetes insipidus, hyperosmotic diuresis caused by diabetes, large-scale use of diuretics, etc. item Loss through the skin Such as heavy sweating and burns. end{enumerate} {(II) Loss of body fluids in the body} begin{enumerate} item Internal blood loss Such as intratissue bleeding caused by closed pelvic fractures and closed long bone fractures, retroperitoneal bleeding caused by kidney rupture, intraperitoneal bleeding caused by liver and spleen rupture, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and ectopic pregnancy, intrathoracic bleeding caused by chest trauma, etc. item Formation of the third space caused by various inflammations such as pleurisy, peritonitis, abscesses, etc. item Intestinal obstruction A large amount of body fluid accumulates in the intestinal cavity and the formation of pleural effusion and ascites. Although the total body fluid volume does not decrease, the effective circulating blood volume is insufficient. end{enumerate} {II. Pathophysiological changes} The pathophysiological response, hemodynamic characteristics and clinical manifestations of hypovolemic shock are all related to the amount, speed and duration of body fluid loss. The loss of intravascular volume reduces the amount of venous return to the heart, and reduces cardiac filling and stroke volume. As a result, cardiac output is reduced and blood pressure drops. Lowered blood pressure can cause decreased coronary blood flow and myocardial ischemia, leading to myocardial dysfunction. Reduced myocardial contractility further reduces cardiac output, forming a vicious cycle. In the compensatory period of shock, the body activates compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood pressure and blood perfusion of vital organs. This is manifested as the excitement of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system, which increases heart rate, enhances myocardial contractility, and increases peripheral vascular resistance. As a result, cardiac output increases and blood pressure rises. The excitement of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the increase in the secretion of neurohypophysial antidiuretic hormone (ADH) cause increased secretion of angiotensin II and aldosterone, leading to water and sodium retention and reduced urine volume to maintain the amount of blood returning to the heart, cardiac output, and arterial blood pressure. Body fluids are redistributed, and interstitial fluid quickly moves into the capillaries. The reabsorption rate can reach $120 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{h}$ in the first few hours. When body fluids are lost slowly over a long period of time, intracellular fluid also moves into the capillaries through the interstitial fluid. The result of the above compensatory reaction is: the perfusion pressure is increased, the body fluid is preserved, and the body fluid is redistributed to ensure the perfusion of important organs (brain, heart). If the low volume cannot be corrected in time, the accumulation of harmful metabolites in the body will cause paralysis of the precapillary arterioles, a large amount of blood will accumulate in the peripheral tissues, the capillary permeability will increase, and the plasma may also leak into the interstitial tissues. Shock enters the decompensation and irreversible stage, and the patient may die due to multiple organ dysfunction or failure. {III. Clinical manifestations} The clinical manifestations and signs of shock are related to the degree of shock (Table 19-1). Table 19-1 Classification of blood loss in hypovolemic shock (taking body weight $70 mathrm{~kg}$ as an example) begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline Classification & Amount of blood loss (ml) & begin{tabular}{c} Ratio of blood loss to blood volume (%) end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Heart rate (beats/min) end{tabular} & Blood pressure & begin{tabular}{c} Respiratory rate (beats/min) end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} Urine output ( $ mathrm{ml} / mathrm{h})$ end{tabular} & Neurological symptoms hline $ mathrm{I}$ & $<750$ & $<15$ & $<100$ & Normal & $14 sim 20$ & $>30$ & Mild anxiety hline II & $750 sim 1500$ & $15 sim 30$ & $>100$ & decrease & $20 sim 30$ & $20 sim 30$ & moderate anxiety hline III & $1500 sim 2000$ & $30 sim 40$ & $>120$ & decrease & $30 sim 40$ & $5 sim 15$ & lethargy hline $ mathrm{IV}$ & $>2000$ & $>40$ & $>140$ & decrease & $>40$ & anuria & lethargy hline end{tabular} end{center} {（一）Central nervous system} In the compensatory stage of shock, most patients are conscious, but may show irritability or apathy. In the decompensated stage, most patients are in a state of lethargy, and some patients have delirium or coma. {(II) Circulatory system} begin{enumerate} item In the compensatory stage of shock, due to the excitement of sympathetic nerves, peripheral vasoconstriction, arterial blood pressure fluctuates greatly, and can be slightly reduced, normal or higher than normal; pulse compression is small, pulse is weak, and heart rate is accelerated. In the decompensated stage, blood pressure is lower than normal, and heart rate is significantly increased. item Stroke volume and cardiac output are reduced, and peripheral vascular resistance (SVR) increases, showing low output and high resistance. As the degree of shock worsens, the above changes become more and more serious. When the shock is irreversible, the blood vessels passively dilate and lose tension. item In the compensatory stage of shock, due to the decrease in venous return, CVP and right atrial pressure are reduced. However, due to compensatory vascular contraction, clinically, CVP may not be proportional to the actual blood volume loss, that is, CVP may be high. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary artery insertion pressure (PAOP) are both lower than normal, reflecting the reduction of pulmonary vascular volume and left ventricular filling. However, in the late stage, due to hypoxia and acidosis, the pulmonary blood vessels contract strongly and the resistance increases significantly. end{enumerate} {(III) Respiratory system} The respiratory rate increases, $20 sim 30$ times per minute, and the respiratory movement is also more intense. Hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis often occur. In the late stage, the compensatory function of breathing has been exhausted, and respiratory failure may occur. {(IV) Kidney} The urine volume decreases, the specific gravity increases, and the urine sodium decreases. Anuria occurs in the late stage of shock. {(V) Others} The skin is cold, moist, pale or mottled (sympathetic nerve excitement). Insufficient tissue perfusion leads to anaerobic metabolism, lactic acid accumulates in the blood, and metabolic acidosis occurs. {IV. Diagnosis} Early diagnosis of hypovolemic shock is crucial to prognosis. Traditional diagnosis is mainly based on medical history, symptoms, and physical signs, including changes in mental status, cold and wet skin, decreased systolic blood pressure ($<90 mmHg$ or a decrease of more than $40 mmHg$ from baseline blood pressure) or decreased pulse pressure $(<20 mmHg)$, urine volume $<0.5 ml/(kg cdot h)$, heart rate $>100$ times/min, central venous pressure $(CVP)<5 mmHg$ or pulmonary artery wedge pressure $(PAWP$)<8 mmHg$. However, in recent years, people have fully realized the limitations of traditional diagnostic criteria. People have found that oxygen metabolism and tissue perfusion indicators have more important reference value for the early diagnosis of hypovolemic shock. Studies have confirmed that blood lactate and base deficit are of great significance in the monitoring and prognosis of hypovolemic shock. In addition, people have pointed out that in shock resuscitation, indicators such as beats per minute $( mathrm{SV})$, cardiac output $( mathrm{CO})$, oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$, oxygen consumption $ left( mathrm{VO}_{2} right)$, gastric mucosal $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ tension and $ mathrm{pH}( mathrm{pHi})$, and mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$ also have a certain degree of clinical significance, but further evidence-based medical support is needed.\n",
      "{V. Treatment Principles} begin{enumerate} item Ensure airway patency and oxygenation function Since the prognosis of shock is related to the balance of oxygen supply/consumption, increasing arterial oxygen content is an important step to improve oxygen supply in the case of tissue hypoperfusion. Airway patency should be maintained, oxygen inhalation therapy should be given, and mechanical ventilation should be performed when necessary to ensure good ventilation and oxygenation. item Treat the primary disease and stop the continued loss of body fluids Take effective measures to treat vomiting, diarrhea, etc.; perform surgery to stop bleeding as soon as possible; treat peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, etc. item Replenish blood volume Hypovolemia is the most common cause of tissue hypoperfusion, and infusion is the first and most important treatment method. The key to fluid selection is how to achieve an appropriate intravascular volume in the safest and most effective way to maintain tissue perfusion. end{enumerate} (1) Crystalloid solution: Commonly used crystalloid solutions are sodium lactate Ringer's solution and normal saline. Because the lost interstitial fluid and the body fluid formed by the third space during hemorrhagic or traumatic shock are functional extracellular fluid, it is necessary to appropriately supplement with fluids with similar components, namely crystalloid fluid. However, after the infusion of crystalloid fluid, most of it will be transferred to the extravascular space and the interstitial space, and only a small part (about $20%$) will remain in the blood vessels. Therefore, when using crystalloid fluid to supplement blood volume, the infusion volume should generally reach $2 to 3$ times the amount of blood loss. Since crystalloid fluid is easy to transfer outside the blood vessels, it is easy to cause peripheral and interstitial edema. (2) Colloid fluid: Commonly used colloid fluids are albumin, plasma and artificial colloid fluid. Colloid fluid can remain in the blood vessels for a long time, thereby effectively replenishing blood volume, and can increase the colloid osmotic pressure, with a better volume expansion effect. However, the capillary permeability of patients with severe trauma increases, and albumin can also penetrate into the interstitial space and cause edema. Artificially synthesized colloid fluids such as dextran, gelatin preparations, and medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch can be retained in the blood vessels for a long time and are ideal plasma substitutes. Appropriate transfusion can increase circulating blood volume, reduce blood viscosity, and improve microcirculation. There is still controversy over whether to choose crystalloid or colloid fluid for volume resuscitation. In terms of the effect, speed, and duration of volume expansion, colloid fluids are significantly better than crystalloid fluids and can maintain the colloidal osmotic pressure of intravascular fluid. However, the half-life of crystalloid fluids in the blood vessels is significantly shorter than that of colloid fluids. (3) Transfusion of whole blood or blood components: There are many cases of transfusion of large amounts of stored blood, and unnecessary transfusions and blood products should be avoided. The treatment goal of hypovolemic shock should be to quickly restore circulating blood volume and maintain the highest oxygen supply with relatively low blood viscosity. It is generally believed that it is best to maintain hemoglobin at $100 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L} and mathrm{Hct}$ at $30%$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Correct electrolyte disturbances and acid-base imbalance. end{enumerate} {Section 3 Septic shock} When the body is severely hit, symptoms and signs such as fever, leukocytosis, increased heart rate and breathing may occur. Since the 1980s, due to the advancement of clinical diagnostic technology, it has been found that the common characteristic change of such patients is the increase of inflammatory mediators in plasma, and bacterial infection is not a necessary condition. For the above reasons, the concept of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was first proposed at a joint meeting held by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) in Chicago in 1991. In December 2001, the five academic groups, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the European Society for Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS), jointly organized the \"International Sepsis Definitions Conference\" in Washington, D.C. The conference once again specifically discussed the concepts, definitions and diagnosis of sepsis and its related terms. The introduction of these concepts has received widespread attention and general recognition, which has also promoted the development of the discipline. SIRS is a systemic inflammatory response that is self-continuously amplified and self-destructive due to infection or non-infection causes. It is a clinical process in which the body has an excessive stress response for repair and survival. When the body is attacked by exogenous damage or infectious toxic substances, it can trigger an initial inflammatory response, and at the same time, the \"cascade effect\" is formed under the joint action of the endogenous immune inflammatory factors produced by the body. Critically ill patients are most likely to develop SIRS due to reduced compensatory anti-inflammatory response and metabolic dysfunction, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in severe cases. SIRS with a definite infection process is called sepsis; sepsis with organ dysfunction is called severe sepsis, and severe sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction (such as refractory hypotension or blood lactate concentration of $ geqslant 4 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ that cannot be reversed by fluid resuscitation) is called septic shock. SIRS, sepsis, septic shock and MODS are different stages of the same pathological process. {I. Etiology} Clinically, many pathogens can cause systemic infection, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, etc. The most common pathogens in surgery are Gram-negative rods that can release endotoxins, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Systemic inflammatory response can be induced through acute peritonitis caused by biliary infection, pancreatitis and gastrointestinal perforation, or through the respiratory system, urogenital system and other pathways. As a result, metabolic disorder, microcirculatory disorder and organ dysfunction can occur. Pathogenic microorganisms located in the infection focus can release exogenous mediators, activate the body's defense system, and lead to the release of endogenous mediators, including cytokines (TNF, IL, IFN, etc.), platelet activating factor, arachidonic acid metabolites, etc. Appropriate amounts of endogenous mediators can have beneficial effects on the body, such as regulating immune function and inactivating bacterial products; while the release of excessive mediators can have harmful effects on the body, which can directly or indirectly damage organ function. Parallel to SIRS is the body's compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). Known anti-inflammatory mediators include interleukins (IL-4, IL-10, IL-11), transforming growth factor-$beta$ (TGF-$beta$) and TNF receptor antagonist (TNFra). Under physiological conditions, the body maintains a balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. If the inflammatory response is too strong, it can cause hypoperfusion and ischemia and hypoxia of the body's tissues. If the anti-inflammatory response is too strong, it can reduce the body's responsiveness and resistance. Generally speaking, after the acute phase of SIRS, the activity of pro-inflammatory factors decreases and is in a relative balance with anti-inflammatory factors, which manifests as mixed anti-inflammatory response syndrome (MARS). Then the CARS state appears. During this period, due to the reduction of immune function, reinfection is prone to occur, causing more severe SIRS or even MODS. Septic shock is common in people with low immunity such as diabetes, liver cirrhosis, leukopenia, etc., especially those with edema or paralysis or receiving cytotoxic drugs, patients using antibiotics, corticosteroids or artificial respiration devices, patients with a history of urinary tract, biliary tract or gastrointestinal infection, and patients with invasive implants including catheters, drainage tubes and other foreign bodies. Septic shock is more common in newborns, patients over 35 years old, pregnant women or patients with severe immunodeficiency caused by primary diseases or patients with complications of iatrogenic treatment. {II. Pathophysiological changes} {(I) Changes in the cardiovascular system} The basic pathophysiological change of septic shock is systemic hypoxia caused by insufficient tissue perfusion. The release of bacterial toxins caused by infection activates the body's immune system and causes the release of neutrophils, endothelial cells, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, leading to a series of changes in the cardiovascular system. begin{enumerate} item Hypovolemia Hypovolemia is one of the main causes of hypotension. The causes of relative volume deficiency include: dilation of arterioles and venous dilation causing blood retention. Causes of absolute volume depletion include: extracorporeal loss of body fluids, increased capillary wall permeability causing intravascular fluid to shift out of the blood vessels. item Vascular dilation It may be related to the decreased affinity between adrenergic receptors and transmitters and the release of vasodilating factors. Studies have found that increased concentrations of phospholipase $ mathrm{A}_{2}$ are directly related to hypotension; tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has a direct vasodilating effect; NO is a potent vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle by increasing the concentration of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle cells. item Myocardial depression Myocardial depression can occur in the early stages of septic shock, which may be related to the negative myocardial inotropic effect of myocardial inhibitors or NO. It manifests as ventricular dilation and decreased ejection fraction. The above is also the theoretical basis for exploring the use of NO synthase inhibitors, oxygen free radical scavengers, IL-1 receptor antagonists and TNF- $ alpha$ monoclonal antibodies to treat septic shock. end{enumerate} {(II) Dysfunction of cellular oxygen uptake} In septic shock, the tissue's ability to take in and utilize oxygen is severely impaired. Even if cardiac output and $ mathrm{DO}_{2}$ increase, oxygen consumption $ left( mathrm{VO}_{2} right)$ may not increase, and tissue hypoxia and increased blood lactate content may still occur. This may be related to factors such as changes in the responsiveness of blood vessels to adrenergic transmitters, intravascular coagulation, and endothelial cell damage. Due to the uncoordinated contraction and relaxation of blood vessels in different parts, blood flow distribution is abnormal, causing the blood vessels in the parts with increased oxygen demand to contract instead, aggravating the hypoperfusion state. {(III) Abnormal fluid distribution} The accumulation of granulocytes, platelets, and fibrin in blood vessels can aggravate abnormal blood flow distribution. Endothelial cell damage can increase vascular permeability, and the transfer of intravascular fluid to the outside of the blood vessels causes tissue edema, further impairing tissue perfusion. During infection, oxygen demand increases, while oxygen supply and oxygen intake are insufficient, resulting in increased anaerobic metabolism and increased blood lactate content. Insufficient tissue perfusion causes cell hypoxia and necrosis, ultimately leading to multiple organ failure and death. {III. Clinical manifestations} According to the hemodynamic characteristics of septic shock, it can generally be divided into two types: hyperdynamic phase and hypodynamic phase. The hyperdynamic phase is more common in the early stage, characterized by normal or higher than normal cardiac output and decreased total systemic vascular resistance. Clinical manifestations are: although the consciousness is clear, the memory is impaired, and the patient is easily excited and irritated; the body temperature rises, the skin is warm, but the color is grayish yellow or flushed; the heart rate accelerates, and the pulse is strong; the breathing is deep and fast, and hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis often occur; the urine volume decreases, and if the fluid is not replenished in time, oliguria or anuria may occur. The hypodynamic phase is more common in the late stage of shock, characterized by decreased cardiac output and increased total systemic vascular resistance. When the heart function is decompensated, the blood pressure decreases. Clinical manifestations include: apathy or loss of consciousness; peripheral vein collapse, cold, pale, cyanotic or macular cyanosis of the skin; tachycardia, weak pulse, sometimes difficult to feel; shallow and rapid breathing, sometimes abnormal breathing; oliguria or anuria; increased blood lactate content in the early stage and metabolic acidosis, mixed acidosis in the late stage, at this time mechanical ventilation should be performed (Table 19-2). However, these two phases are not fixed, but change dynamically, and change with the replenishment of body fluids and the improvement of cardiac function. The patient's condition can fluctuate between the hyperdynamic phase and the hypodynamic phase throughout the course of the disease, and is related to factors such as the speed and extent of infection spread, treatment measures, and the patient's response to treatment. Table 19-2 Clinical manifestations of septic shock begin{center} begin{tabular}{lll} hline & Warm shock (hyperdynamic type) & Cold shock (hypodynamic type) hline Consciousness & Awake & Agitation, apathy, or drowsiness Skin color & Pale or flushed & Pale, cyanosis Skin temperature & Warm, dry & Clammy Capillary refill time & $1 sim 2$ seconds & Prolonged Pulse & Clear pulsation & Fine and rapid Pulse pressure $( mathrm{mmHg})$ & $>30$ & $<30$ Urine volume $( mathrm{ml} / mathrm{h})$ & $>30$ & $<25$ hline end{tabular} end{center} {IV. Diagnosis} The diagnosis of septic shock mainly focuses on the following three aspects: manifestations of shock, manifestations of sepsis and infection, and confirmation of infection foci. After adequate fluid replacement and exclusion of other causes, systolic blood pressure is $<90 mathrm{mmHg}$, or decreases by $ geqslant 40 mathrm{mmHg}$ compared with the baseline value, accompanied by clinical manifestations of insufficient tissue perfusion, such as lactic acidosis, oliguria, and sudden changes in consciousness.\n",
      "{(II) Start CPR as soon as possible} CPR is the key to resuscitation. CPR should be started immediately after EMSs are activated. External chest compression is an important measure of CPR because tissue perfusion during CPR mainly depends on chest compression. Therefore, external chest compression should be given priority at the beginning of adult CPR. Traditional CPR procedures put artificial respiration first, but this may affect the willingness of bystanders to participate in rescue and prevent them from participating in early resuscitation in time. Possible reasons include: lack of resuscitation training; complicated operations, especially artificial respiration; rescuers are afraid of being hurt and are unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth (nose) artificial respiration, which often delays the start of resuscitation. In fact, oxygen still remains in the patient's lungs and blood in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest. Early initiation of external chest compression can establish blood circulation as early as possible and bring oxygen to the brain and heart. Therefore, the 2010 AHA resuscitation guidelines changed the order of adult CPR from A-B-C to C-A-B, and recommended that non-professionals should first perform simple chest compressions during on-site resuscitation. This is more easily accepted by most bystanders and can start cardiopulmonary resuscitation earlier. After chest compressions have begun, artificial respiration can be started. During artificial respiration, each air delivery time should be greater than 1 second to avoid excessive airway pressure; the tidal volume should be sufficient to see the chest rise and fall, and excessive ventilation should be avoided as much as possible; first perform 30 chest compressions, then 2 artificial respirations, and then perform resuscitation with a ratio of $30:2$ of chest compressions to artificial respirations until an artificial airway is established. Heart compressions should be continuous and should not be interrupted for artificial respirations. begin{enumerate} item Circulatory support Heart compressions are measures that apply pressure to the heart indirectly or directly to maintain the heart's filling and pumping functions and to induce the recovery of the heart's spontaneous beats. When performed correctly, the cardiac output and arterial blood pressure can generally be kept basically meeting the body's low-level requirements, thus playing the role of artificial circulation. end{enumerate} (1) External chest compression (ECC): The method of indirectly compressing the heart by applying pressure outside the chest wall is called external chest compression or closed heart compression. There are two explanations for the mechanism by which external chest compression can induce blood circulation. Traditionally, it is believed that during ECC, compression causes the sternum to sink, squeezing the heart between the sternum and spine, increasing the pressure inside the left and right ventricles, causing the mitral and tricuspid valves to close and the aortic and pulmonary valves to open, driving blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery, respectively, just like the systole of a normal heartbeat to form systemic and pulmonary circulations. When the compression is released, the thorax recovers elastically, allowing the left and right ventricles to refill, which is equivalent to the diastole of a normal heartbeat, forming an artificial circulation to supply blood to the heart, brain and other organs. This is called the heart pump mechanism of ECC. Research in the late 1970s showed that during chest compression, the pressure in each heart chamber and large blood vessels in the chest cavity generally increased, and there was almost no pressure difference; any measure that could increase the intrathoracic pressure could increase the pressure in the heart chamber and large blood vessels in the chest cavity and form blood flow; the venous valve of the vena cava at the entrance of the chest cavity could block the backflow of blood, but the mitral valve did not close, and the blood went directly from the lungs to the aorta. Therefore, it is believed that the change in intrathoracic pressure caused by compression of the chest wall plays a major role. During external chest compression, the intrathoracic pressure increased significantly, and this pressure could be transmitted to the heart and large blood vessels in the chest, and then to the blood vessels outside the chest cavity, driving the blood to flow forward. The blood volume in the lungs was passively squeezed to the left heart and then to the systemic circulation through the aorta; when the compression was released, the intrathoracic pressure dropped and was lower than the atmospheric pressure, and the venous blood flowed back to the heart, which was called the chest pump mechanism. In clinical practice, these two explanations are not mutually exclusive. As long as the operation is correct, a temporary artificial circulation can be established. During external chest compression, arterial pressure can reach $80 sim 100 mathrm{mmHg}$ or higher; but diastolic pressure is difficult to reach $40 mathrm{mmHg}$, carotid pressure is only about $40 mathrm{mmHg}$, and carotid blood flow is only equivalent to $1/4 sim 1/3$ of normal. However, the rise of central venous pressure (systolic period) and venous pressure is almost similar to arterial pressure. Therefore, tissue perfusion pressure is extremely low and it is difficult to fully meet the needs of tissue cell metabolism. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, aortic diastolic pressure is positively correlated with the recovery of autonomous circulation function, and a higher coronary perfusion pressure will indicate the recovery of autonomous circulation. If adrenaline can be used at the same time during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, aortic diastolic pressure can be maintained at a higher level, and myocardial and cerebral blood flow will also increase significantly, thereby improving the effect of resuscitation. The advantage of external chest compression is that it is easy to master and can be performed anytime and anywhere. Therefore, non-professionals on the scene can start resuscitation immediately, which can buy extremely precious time and lay a good foundation for future resuscitation. When performing external cardiac compression, the patient lies on his back, keeps his head at the same level as the heart, and has a hard support such as a wooden board on his back. The site of external cardiac compression is $1/2$ below the sternum or $4 sim 5 mathrm{~cm}$ above the xiphoid process. The rescuer stands or kneels on the side of the patient, places the base of one palm on the compression point, and the base of the other palm covers the former. The fingers are raised upward, the arms are perpendicular to the horizontal plane, and the arms and palms are used to apply vertical pressure to the sternum by their own gravity. External cardiac compression should be strong and rapid, and the chest should be completely restored to its original position after each compression, but the palm should not leave the sternum. If the chest cannot be completely restored, it may lead to increased intrathoracic pressure, affect the return of venous blood and cardiac output, and reduce the perfusion of coronary arteries and brain tissue. Repeated operation, the heart discharges blood during compression and refills during release, forming artificial circulation (Figure 20-1). The frequency and duration of cardiac compression are very important for the recovery of spontaneous heartbeat. During CPR, coronary perfusion depends on the proportion of compression time to the cardiac compression cycle (including compression and release time) and the degree of chest rebound after compression. Studies have shown that coronary and brain perfusion is best when the compression time accounts for $20% sim 50%$ of the compression cycle. According to the chest spring mechanism, the circulating blood flow is the largest when the time of external chest compression and release is equal. For ease of operation and easy mastery, it is recommended that the cardiac compression time accounts for $50%$ of the compression cycle, that is, the compression and release time are equal. According to the 2010 AHA resuscitation guidelines, the quality of resuscitation is an important factor affecting the prognosis of resuscitation. High-quality resuscitation measures include: the frequency of chest compressions should be changed from 100 times/minute to at least 100 times/minute; the compression depth should be at least $1/3$ of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest or at least $5 mathrm{~cm}$, which is about $4 mathrm{~cm}$ for most infants and about $5 mathrm{~cm}$ for children; it is required to ensure that the chest fully rebounds after each compression; the continuity of chest compressions should be maintained, and begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-208(1)} end{center} Figure 20-1 Chest compressions should avoid or reduce interruptions in chest compressions due to artificial respiration or defibrillation. During chest compressions, fatigue is likely to occur, which will affect the frequency and depth of chest compressions. Therefore, if there are more than two people performing chest compressions, it is recommended to switch positions every 2 minutes. However, the exchange should not affect the compression. One person should perform compression on one side of the patient, while the other person should prepare to replace him on the opposite side. As soon as the other person's palm leaves the chest wall, the other person should immediately take over and perform cardiac compression. During cardiac compression, the number and time of interruption or suspension of compression should be minimized. Whether it is artificial respiration, electric defibrillation, establishment of artificial airway or inspection, the principle should be not to interfere with cardiac compression. Because the longer the cardiac compression is stopped, the worse the resuscitation effect. The ratio of cardiac compression to artificial respiration is $30:2$, until the artificial airway is established. After the artificial airway is established, artificial respiration can be performed every $6 sim 8$ seconds or $8 sim 10$ times/minute without interrupting cardiac compression. (2) Open chest cardiac compression (OCC): Cutting the chest wall and directly compressing the heart is called open chest cardiac compression or intrathoracic cardiac compression. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, increasing coronary perfusion pressure is the key to restoring autonomous heart rhythm, and coronary perfusion pressure is the difference between aortic diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Therefore, how to increase aortic diastolic pressure is very critical. The cardiac output during external chest compression is only $10% sim 33%$ of that before cardiac arrest, and the myocardial perfusion pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure are also very low. Studies have shown that regular open-chest cardiac compression can better maintain hemodynamic stability than external chest compression; changing from external chest compression to open-chest cardiac compression can improve cardiac output index, coronary artery and brain perfusion, with cardiac output index reaching 52% of normal people, coronary blood flow reaching more than 50% of normal people, and cerebral blood flow reaching more than 60% of normal people. Open-chest cardiac compression is not only easier to stimulate the recovery of autonomous circulation, but also has less impact on central venous pressure and intracardiac pressure, which is beneficial to improving coronary perfusion and protecting brain cell function. Therefore, for patients with severe chest deformity, tension pneumothorax caused by chest trauma, cardiac tamponade, mechanical valve replacement, ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm, and cardiac arrest after open-chest surgery, open-chest cardiac compression should be the first choice. For patients with poor results from external chest compression, open-chest cardiac compression should be used as long as the conditions for open-chest compression are met. Especially in the operating room, begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-208} end{center} Figure 20-2 Open-chest cardiac compression While performing external chest compression, actively prepare for open-chest compression. Once preparations are ready and external chest compression is still ineffective, open-chest cardiac compression should be performed immediately. The open-chest incision for open-chest cardiac compression can be selected from the 4th intercostal space on the left edge of the sternum, and cut along the intercostal space to the left anterior axillary line. After the pleura is incised, the surgeon can extend one hand to the mediastinum and hold the heart in the palm of his hand for compression (Figure 20-2). Avoid using the fingertips to apply pressure during compression to avoid damaging the myocardium; use the four fingers other than the thumb to press against the thenar muscles or the sternum. If there is a lot of effusion in the pericardium or the heart is significantly enlarged, the pericardium can also be cut open for compression within the pericardium, otherwise the compression effect will be difficult to satisfy. After the spontaneous heartbeat is restored, the circulation is basically stable, and there is no active bleeding in the chest cavity, the chest can be closed. The chest wall should be sutured in layers and closed drainage should be placed. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Respiratory support The technology of replacing the patient's spontaneous breathing to ventilate the alveoli is called artificial respiration. Artificial respiration includes manual artificial respiration, artificial respiration with a simple respirator, and mechanical ventilation. end{enumerate} (1) Management of the respiratory tract: Keeping the respiratory tract open is a prerequisite for effective artificial respiration. Respiratory obstruction is often the cause of cardiac arrest. Respiratory obstruction should be relieved as soon as possible, and an artificial airway should be established as soon as possible when conditions permit. For details on the causes, symptoms and treatment of respiratory obstruction, as well as commonly used artificial airways, please refer to Chapter 6. (2) Mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration: Manual artificial respiration is an important artificial respiration method during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The most commonly used method is mouth-to-mouth (nose) or mouth-to-mask artificial respiration. Although this method contains $4%$ of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and only $17%$ of $ mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the inhaled air, it is sufficient to maintain life. Its advantage is that it does not require any special equipment and is suitable for on-site resuscitation. When performing mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration, the respiratory tract should be kept open first. The operator holds the patient's head back with one hand and pinches his nostrils closed, and places the other hand behind the patient's neck and lifts it up. Take a deep breath and blow hard into the patient's mouth; after each blow, remove the mouth and take a deep breath. At this time, the patient passively exhales by the elastic contraction of the chest. Studies have shown that during CPR, cardiac output is very low, and the oxygen taken from the alveoli and the $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffused from the blood to the alveoli are also relatively reduced. Therefore, a lower alveolar ventilation can maintain effective ventilation and ventilation/perfusion ratio. During adult CPR, when an artificial airway is not established, the tidal volume is about $500 sim 600 mathrm{ml}$ based on the visible chest rise and fall; each blowing time should be longer than 1 second to reduce airway pressure; 2 artificial respirations are performed for every 30 chest compressions, and the respiratory rate is $6 sim 8$ times/minute. During artificial respiration, try not to interrupt chest compressions and avoid overventilation, because overventilation can not only increase intrathoracic pressure and affect venous return and reduce cardiac output, but also easily cause gastric distension, reflux and aspiration. (3) Simple artificial respirators and mechanical ventilation: Any respirator that is easy to carry to the scene for artificial respiration is a simple respirator. Among various simple respirators, the mask-respirator artificial respirator has the simplest structure, consisting of a mask, a breathing valve and a breathing tube. When in use, buckle the mask to the patient's mouth and nose, and squeeze the breathing tube to blow gas into the patient's lungs. When the breathing tube is released, the gas is exhaled with the elastic contraction of the chest and lungs, and discharged into the atmosphere through the valve. After the artificial airway is established, the respirator can also be connected to the artificial airway for artificial respiration. There is a side tube and an oxygen storage tank at the far end of the breathing tube, which can be connected to an oxygen source to appropriately increase the concentration of inhaled oxygen. Use a mechanical device (ventilator) to assist or replace the patient's spontaneous breathing,\n",
      "Among the respirators, the mask-respirator artificial respirator has the simplest structure, which consists of a mask, a respiratory valve and a breathing chamber. When in use, the mask is buckled on the patient's mouth and nose, and the gas can be blown into the patient's lungs by squeezing the breathing chamber. When the breathing chamber is released, the gas is exhaled with the elastic recoil of the chest and lungs, and discharged into the atmosphere through the valve. After the artificial airway is established, the respirator can also be connected to the artificial airway for artificial respiration. There is a side tube and an oxygen storage chamber at the far end of the breathing chamber, which can be connected to the oxygen source to appropriately increase the concentration of inhaled oxygen. The use of a mechanical device (ventilator) to assist or replace the patient's spontaneous breathing is called mechanical ventilation. An artificial airway must be established for mechanical ventilation, which is mainly used for advanced life support and post-resuscitation treatment, and is suitable for use in fixed medical places such as hospitals, ICUs or operating rooms. During mechanical ventilation, attention should be paid to the effect of positive pressure ventilation on circulatory function, and excessive airway pressure and excessive ventilation should be avoided. The tidal volume is generally set to no more than $8 ml / kg, and the frequency is preferably $8 sim 10 times / minute. {(III) Perform defibrillation as soon as possible} Defibrillation is a method of using a certain amount of current to shock the heart to terminate ventricular fibrillation, and direct current defibrillation is the most widely used method. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation (abbreviated as \"VF\") is the highest in cardiac arrest. Holter monitoring results show that more than $85%$ of patients who have cardiac arrest outside the hospital have ventricular tachycardia at the beginning, which quickly turns into ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation is currently the most effective method for treating ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. For patients with ventricular fibrillation, if defibrillation is delayed, the success rate of defibrillation is significantly reduced. Defibrillation within 4 minutes after ventricular fibrillation and within 8 minutes of CPR can significantly improve their prognosis. Within a few minutes after ventricular fibrillation occurs, the heart can develop into cardiac arrest, and resuscitation is more difficult. Therefore, the speed of defibrillation is the key to successful resuscitation. One of the purposes of early EMS is to get an automated external defibrillator (AED) as soon as possible so that defibrillation can be performed in time. According to the amplitude and frequency of the electrocardiogram waveform, ventricular fibrillation can be divided into coarse and fine fibrillation. Severe myocardial ischemia can weaken the electrical activity of the myocardium, reduce the amplitude and frequency, and become fine fibrillation. If fine fibrillation cannot be converted into coarse fibrillation, the defibrillation effect and prognosis are poor. Various measures of initial resuscitation plus injection of epinephrine can generally convert fine fibrillation into coarse fibrillation. Currently, all defibrillators on the market are biphasic defibrillators, but there are also single-phase defibrillators produced in the past. The energy required for defibrillation by biphasic defibrillators is relatively low ($leqslant 200 mathrm{~J}$), and the defibrillation success rate is also higher, but there is no evidence of improving the discharge rate. When the electrode pads are placed on the chest wall for electric shock during defibrillation, it is called external defibrillation. When the electrode pads are placed directly on the ventricular wall after opening the chest, it is called internal defibrillation. When external defibrillation is performed, one electrode pad is placed at the second intercostal space near the right edge of the sternum, and the other electrode pad is placed at the apex of the left chest wall. Saline gauze or conductive paste should be placed under the electrodes and pressed tightly against the chest wall to avoid local burns and reduce the defibrillation effect. When using a biphasic defibrillator, the electric energy of an adult external defibrillation is $leqslant 200 mathrm{~J}$ (joules); when using a single-phase defibrillator, it is $360 mathrm{~J}$. The energy for children at the beginning is generally $2 mathrm{~J}/mathrm{kg}$, and the second defibrillation is $4 mathrm{~J}/mathrm{kg}$, with a maximum of no more than $10 mathrm{~J}/mathrm{kg}$. The energy of intrathoracic defibrillation starts from $10 mathrm{~J}$ for adults and generally does not exceed $40 mathrm{~J}$; for children, it starts from $5 mathrm{~J}$ and generally does not exceed 20J. After defibrillation, external chest compression and artificial respiration should be performed immediately. Supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia can also be treated with electrical cardioversion, but the required electrical energy is lower. The energy required to treat atrial fibrillation in adults is $120 sim 200 mathrm{~J}$, and $50 sim 100 mathrm{~J}$ for atrial flutter. The energy required to treat supraventricular tachycardia in children is $0.5 sim 1 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{kg}$, and does not exceed $2 mathrm{~J} / mathrm{kg}$. {Section 2 Advanced Life Support} Advanced Life Support (ACLS) is a continuation of basic life support. It is a stage of resuscitation in which professionals strive for the best efficacy and prognosis with high-quality resuscitation techniques, resuscitation equipment, devices and drug treatment. It is also an important link in the chain of survival. The content of ACLS includes: {(I) Maintaining airway patency and effective artificial respiration support} The importance of artificial respiration and oxygen supply should be emphasized during the advanced life support stage. In fact, external chest compression and artificial respiration are indispensable during CPR. We should take advantage of the advantages and conditions of professionals to perform higher-quality cardiac compression and artificial respiration to fully improve the blood perfusion and oxygen supply of vital organs. Inhaling high-concentration oxygen during CPR can significantly increase the oxygen content in arterial blood, thereby increasing the oxygen delivery volume, which is beneficial to cardiac resuscitation. Although inhaling high-concentration oxygen has the potential risk of oxygen poisoning, there is currently no evidence that inhaling high-concentration oxygen for a short period of time during CPR is harmful. However, after the spontaneous circulation function is restored, that is, in the early stage of organ reperfusion, the inspired oxygen concentration should be adjusted to $ mathrm{SpO}_{2} geqslant 94%$ to avoid potential oxygen poisoning. In order to obtain good lung ventilation effect, the airway must be kept open and an artificial airway must be established in time, which is more conducive to cardiac resuscitation and further treatment after resuscitation. It is generally believed that the best choice in ACLS is endotracheal intubation, which can not only ensure the ventilation and oxygen supply of CPR, prevent aspiration, and avoid interruption of external chest compression, but also monitor the end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure $ left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2} right)$, which is conducive to improving the quality of $ mathrm{CPR}$. The positioning of endotracheal intubation is very important. When the patient has been transferred to the medical unit, the chest $ mathrm{X}$ line film should be routinely checked to confirm that the distal end of the endotracheal tube is above the tracheal carina. Tidal volume and respiratory rate should be appropriately reduced, with respiratory rate of $8 sim 10$ times/min, airway pressure maintained below $30 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, and overventilation should be avoided. {(II) Restoration and maintenance of spontaneous circulation} During ACLS, efforts should be made to restore and maintain spontaneous circulation, with emphasis on high-quality CPR, and early defibrillation for patients with ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. For patients with cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, early CPR and rapid defibrillation can significantly increase the survival rate and discharge rate of patients; for patients with other types of cardiac arrest, the primary task of ACLS is to adopt high-quality resuscitation techniques and drug therapy to quickly restore and maintain spontaneous heartbeat. After CPR, patients with spontaneous circulation recovery enter the post-resuscitation treatment stage, and should avoid recurrence of cardiac arrest, and use fluid therapy and drugs to maintain circulatory stability in order to improve the patient's prognosis. High-quality CPR, drug therapy and standardized resuscitation procedures are very important for restoring spontaneous heartbeat. After CPR begins, consider whether to perform defibrillation. The use of AED can automatically identify whether it is ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/ $ mathrm{VT}$ ). If the diagnosis of VF/VT is established, defibrillation should be performed immediately. Immediately after defibrillation, CPR should be performed for 2 minutes, and an intravenous access (IV) or intraosseous access (IO) should be established for drug therapy. After 2 minutes of CPR, check the heart rhythm again. If it is still VF/VT, defibrillate again and continue CPR for 2 minutes; give epinephrine through IV/IO (can be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes), establish an artificial airway at the same time, and monitor $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . If VF/VT is still present after defibrillation and CPR for 2 minutes, defibrillation and CPR can be continued for 2 minutes. At the same time, antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone can be considered for treatment, and treatment should be carried out according to the cause. This treatment should be repeated until the patient's spontaneous heartbeat is restored. In order to perform high-quality CPR to promote the restoration of spontaneous circulation, it is very important to monitor the patient's physiological functions and vital signs, such as ECG, CO2, arterial blood pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, etc. At the same time, attention should be paid to the treatment of the cause, especially for those who have difficulty in restoring their spontaneous heartbeat or have restored their spontaneous heartbeat but have difficulty maintaining stable circulation. {(III) Treatment of symptomatic bradycardia and tachycardia} begin{enumerate} item Bradycardia It is generally believed that a heart rate below 60 beats/min can be diagnosed as bradycardia, but the heart rate that can cause clinical symptoms is generally below 50 beats/min. Therefore, we should first determine whether bradycardia causes clinical symptoms or affects circulatory stability, and then determine the cause of bradycardia. If bradycardia causes unstable circulatory function, acute mental disorder, etc., it should be treated immediately. The first choice of drug is atropine, $0.5 mathrm{mg}$ (intravenous injection), which can be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. Dopamine, epinephrine or isoproterenol can be used for those who are ineffective. For patients with severe heart block, external or transvenous pacing should be performed. Item Tachycardia Generally speaking, a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute can be diagnosed as tachycardia, but it can cause obvious clinical symptoms, and the heart rate is mostly greater than 150 beats/minute. When tachycardia occurs, we should first distinguish whether tachycardia is the cause of clinical symptoms or secondary to other diseases. If the heart rate is less than 150 beats/minute, it generally does not cause obvious instability unless ventricular function has been damaged. If tachycardia is detected, the first thing to do is to keep the patient's airway open, give oxygen and respiratory support. If the patient's condition does not improve after oxygen inhalation, it is necessary to identify whether the patient is in an unstable state and its relationship with tachycardia. If the patient develops hypotension, sudden changes in consciousness, shock, ischemic chest pain or acute heart failure, synchronized cardioversion should be performed immediately. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{(IV) Monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation} While performing CPR without affecting external chest compression, necessary monitoring methods and infusion routes should be established immediately to facilitate the diagnosis of the condition and drug treatment. The main monitoring contents include: begin{enumerate} item Electrocardiogram (ECG) If the cardiac arrest is caused by ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, electric defibrillation should be performed as soon as possible. Other arrhythmias may also occur during the resuscitation process. ECG monitoring can clarify their nature and provide an extremely important basis for treatment. item End-tidal $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (end-tidal $ mathrm{CO}_{2}, mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) $ quad mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ refers to the concentration or partial pressure of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the exhaled gas at the end of expiration, and the normal value is $35 sim 40 mathrm{mmHg}$ . In recent years, continuous monitoring of $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ during resuscitation is used to judge the effect of CPR and is a relatively reliable indicator. During resuscitation, the discharge of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the body mainly depends on the cardiac output and the perfusion of the lung tissue. When cardiac output and pulmonary perfusion are very low, $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is very low ( $<10 mathrm{mmHg}$ ); when cardiac output increases, $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases ( $>20 mathrm{mmHg}$ ), indicating that external chest compression significantly increases cardiac output; if $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}>10 mathrm{mmHg}$ can be maintained, it means that cardiopulmonary resuscitation is effective. When spontaneous circulation function is restored, the earliest change is a sudden increase in $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which can reach more than $40 mathrm{mmHg}$. Therefore, continuous monitoring of $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can determine the effect of external cardiac compression and improve the quality of CPR. item Invasive arterial blood pressure (IABP) Blood pressure is a basic parameter for measuring the state of circulatory function. If direct IABP can be monitored during CPR, it can not only evaluate the coronary perfusion pressure during cardiac compression in real time, but also evaluate the effectiveness of cardiac compression, which can be used to guide the improvement of the quality of compression. If the diastolic pressure is lower than $ mathrm{mmHg}$ during external cardiac compression, it is difficult to restore the spontaneous heartbeat. item Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring CPP is the difference between the aortic diastolic pressure and the right atrial diastolic pressure, which is very important for improving myocardial blood perfusion and the recovery of spontaneous heartbeat. Clinical observations show that when CPP is lower than $ mathrm{mmHg}$ during CPR, it is difficult to restore the spontaneous heartbeat. Since peripheral arterial diastolic pressure is very close to aortic diastolic pressure, monitoring arterial pressure is of great significance for evaluating the effectiveness of CPR and whether the autonomous heartbeat can be restored. item Central venous pressure (CVP) refers to the average pressure of the superior and inferior vena cava or right atrium in the chest cavity. CVP has important clinical significance for evaluating the relationship between right heart function and its preload. Monitoring CVP in the post-resuscitation treatment phase can evaluate whether there is hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction, and it is also a very effective venous access. item Pulse oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SpO}_{2} right)$ During $ mathrm{CPR}$, due to low cardiac output and poor peripheral blood perfusion, it is difficult to monitor $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$. Only after the autonomous heartbeat is restored and the systemic circulation status improves, can $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ be monitored. Therefore, if $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ can be monitored during $ mathrm{CPR}$, it means that the resuscitation is effective. item Central venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{ScvO}_{2} right) quad mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ has a good correlation with mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$ and is an important parameter reflecting tissue oxygen balance. The normal value of $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $70% sim 80%$. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is greater than $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$, the spontaneous heartbeat may be restored; if $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ is greater than $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$, the spontaneous heartbeat may have been restored. Therefore, continuous monitoring of $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ during $ mathrm{CPR}$ provides an objective indicator for judging whether myocardial oxygen supply is sufficient and whether spontaneous circulation can be restored. end{enumerate} {(V) Medication during CPR} The purpose of medication during resuscitation is to stimulate the heart to resume beating and enhance myocardial contractility, prevent and treat arrhythmias, adjust acute acid-base imbalance, and replenish body fluids and electrolytes. begin{enumerate} item Routes of administration Medication during resuscitation must be rapid and accurate. The preferred route of administration for all drugs is intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO). If a central venous catheter is already in place, drugs should be administered through the central vein. If no central venous catheter is in place, drugs can be administered through cubital vein puncture. If it is difficult to establish intravenous access, especially in cardiac arrest secondary to hypovolemic shock, intraosseous injection access can be quickly established. To establish an intraosseous injection access, a bone marrow puncture needle can be used to puncture the tibia vertically $1 sim 3 mathrm{~cm}$ below the tibia in front and the tuberosity. If bone marrow can be seen when the syringe is aspirated, it means that the puncture is successful. Infusion and medication can be given through the bone marrow, and its effect is equivalent to that of the intravenous route. If the intravenous or intraosseous route cannot be established quickly due to technical difficulties, medication can also be given through endotracheal intubation. Epinephrine, lidocaine, and atropine can all be administered through the trachea, while sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride cannot be administered through the trachea. Because of the high incidence of complications caused by intracardiac injection, such as tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, myocardial or coronary vascular laceration, etc., it is generally not recommended. end{enumerate} {2. Commonly used drugs} (1) Epinephrine: It is the first choice drug for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Its pharmacological characteristics are as follows: (1) It has the effects of stimulating $alpha$ and $beta$ adrenergic receptors, which helps the arrested heart to restore its own rhythm; (2) Its $alpha$ receptor stimulating effect can increase the total resistance of peripheral blood vessels without increasing the resistance of coronary and cerebral vessels, thereby increasing the perfusion of the myocardium and brain; (3) It can enhance the contractility of the myocardium. After using epinephrine, the fine fibrillation wave of ventricular fibrillation can be converted into coarse fibrillation wave, which significantly improves the success rate of electric defibrillation; (4) It can increase diastolic blood pressure and improve the perfusion pressure of coronary and brain. If cardiac compression fails to restore heartbeat, adrenaline $0.5 sim 1.0 mathrm{mg}$, or $0.01 sim$ $0.02 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ can be injected intravenously to promote the recovery of heartbeat. If necessary, the injection can be repeated, and the repeated administration time is $3 sim 5$ minutes. Some people advocate the use of large doses of $(0.1 sim 0.2 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg})$ of adrenaline during CPR, but clinical studies have shown that although large doses of adrenaline can increase the heart rate of resuscitation, it does not increase the survival rate of patients with cardiac arrest. (2) Vasopressin: It is an antidiuretic hormone. When used in large doses or in excess of normal doses, it can act on the $ mathrm{V}_{1}$ receptors of vascular smooth muscle, producing non-adrenaline-like vasoconstriction and increasing peripheral vascular resistance. Its half-life is $10 sim 20$ minutes, which is longer than that of epinephrine. Clinical studies have shown that vasopressin is as effective as epinephrine in CPR, but it has not been shown to be better than epinephrine. A multicenter, randomized study compared the effects of the first two applications of vasopressin or epinephrine in the resuscitation of 1,186 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the survival rate (36% vs $31%$) and discharge rate $(10% mathrm{vs} 10%)$ between the two groups. Some studies believe that in patients with prolonged or difficult resuscitation, vasopressin may be better than epinephrine in maintaining hemodynamics, or that using vasopressin first and then epinephrine may improve the prognosis of resuscitation. The combined use of vasopressin and epinephrine may be more effective. The single and repeated doses of vasopressin are $40 mathrm{U}, mathrm{IV} / mathrm{IO}$. (3) Lidocaine: It can restore or increase the fibrillation threshold of the myocardium that is reduced due to ischemia or infarction, and increase the stress threshold of the myocardium to ectopic electrical stimulation during ventricular diastole. It is particularly suitable for the treatment of ventricular premature beats and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. For cases in which ventricular fibrillation recurs after defibrillation and requires repeated defibrillation, lidocaine can reduce the irritability of the myocardium or alleviate the recurrence of ventricular fibrillation. During CPR, in order to quickly reach and maintain an appropriate blood drug concentration, the dose used can be relatively large. The starting dose for a single intravenous injection is $1 sim 1.5 mg/kg, which can be repeated every $5 sim 10 minutes, with a repeat dose of $0.5 sim$ $0.75 mg/kg. Once sinus rhythm is restored, continuous intravenous infusion can be given at a rate of $2 sim 4 mg/min. (4) Amiodarone: Amiodarone has sodium, potassium, and ion channel blocking effects, and has $alpha$ and $beta$ adrenergic receptor antagonist function. Therefore, it is effective in treating both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. During CPR, if ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is ineffective against defibrillation, CPR, or vasopressors, amiodarone can be considered. Studies have shown that amiodarone has certain advantages in treating ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, but the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia is high. The initial single dose of amiodarone for adults is $300 mathrm{mg}$ (or $5 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$ ) IV/IO, and $150 mathrm{mg}$ (or $2.5 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{kg}$) can be repeatedly injected if necessary. The dosage range for maintenance with amiodarone is $10 sim 30 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min}), which is halved after 6$ hours.\n",
      "{Chapter 20 Cardiopulmonary and Brain Resuscitation} The following drugs have been used as routine drugs in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but they are all listed as unconventional drugs in the 2010 AHA resuscitation guidelines. (5) Atropine: Atropine has a certain therapeutic effect on sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction disorders caused by vagal nerve dysfunction. However, there are no prospective biological and clinical controlled studies to prove that atropine can improve the prognosis of cardiac asystole and PEA. Therefore, the 2010 AHA resuscitation guidelines do not recommend the routine use of atropine in cardiac asystole and PEA. However, atropine is still the first-line drug for clinical symptoms or signs caused by severe bradycardia (such as sudden changes in consciousness, hypotension, etc.). (6) Sodium bicarbonate: During CPR, cardiac output is very low, tissue perfusion and oxygen supply are insufficient, leading to increased anaerobic metabolism and lactic acidosis. The most effective way to correct metabolic acidosis during CPR is to improve the quality of CPR, increase cardiac output and tissue perfusion, improve ventilation and oxygen supply, and facilitate the recovery of spontaneous circulation. During cardiac compression, cardiac output is very low. Although artificial ventilation can maintain the $ mathrm{pH}$ of arterial blood at a normal or high level, acidic metabolites and $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in venous blood and tissues cannot be discharged, resulting in a decrease in $ mathrm{pH}$ and an increase in $ mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. The administered sodium bicarbonate can dissociate to generate more $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which cannot be discharged in time, which can also reduce $ mathrm{pH}$. At the same time, due to the strong diffusion ability of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, it can freely pass through the blood-brain barrier and cell membrane, causing more severe acidosis in brain tissue and cells. Therefore, the routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended during resuscitation. For patients with known pre-existing severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, tricyclic or barbiturate overdose, sodium bicarbonate solution may be considered. The initial dose of sodium bicarbonate is $1 mathrm{mmol}/mathrm{kg}$, which can be repeated every 10 minutes at $0.5 mathrm{mmol}/mathrm{kg}$. It is best to calculate and give according to the results of arterial blood gas analysis according to the following formula: $5 % mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}( mathrm{ml})= triangle mathrm{BE}( mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}) times 0.2 times$ body weight $( mathrm{kg}) / 0.6$ $ triangle mathrm{BE}$ is the difference between the target value of residual alkali and the measured value; $5 % mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} 1 mathrm{ml}=0.6 mathrm{mmol} mathrm{HCO}$ {Section 3 Post-resuscitation treatment} Systematic and effective post-cardiac arrest resuscitation treatment (post-cardiac arrest care, PCAC) can not only reduce the early mortality caused by post-resuscitation circulatory instability and the late mortality caused by multiple organ failure and brain damage, but also improve the quality of life of survivors. Therefore, once the spontaneous circulation of patients with cardiac arrest is restored, they should be immediately transferred to a medical unit with conditions, preferably an ICU, for post-resuscitation treatment. The main tasks of PCAC include: maintaining hemodynamic stability and oxygenation to improve tissue perfusion and oxygen supply of vital organs, protecting brain cells with controlled hypothermia to promote the recovery of neurological function, preventing and treating multiple organ dysfunction or failure, treating the cause, especially interventional treatment of acute coronary syndrome. {I. Respiratory management} Once spontaneous circulation is restored, the patency of the respiratory tract or artificial airway and effective artificial respiration should be checked again to maintain good respiratory function. For those who have recovered spontaneous respiration, routine oxygen therapy should be performed, and the patient's respiratory rate, $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ should be closely monitored. For those who are still in a coma, or whose spontaneous breathing has not yet recovered, or who have ventilation or oxygenation dysfunction, mechanical ventilation treatment should be performed, and the ventilator parameters should be adjusted according to the results of blood gas analysis to maintain $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ at around $ mathrm{mmHg}$, $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ at $40 sim 45 mathrm{mmHg}$, or $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at $35 sim 40 mathrm{mmHg}$. Traditionally, it is believed that mild hyperventilation is helpful in relieving intracranial hypertension. Although hyperventilation can reduce $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and help reduce intracranial pressure, it can cause cerebral vasoconstriction and reduce cerebral blood perfusion, leading to further brain damage, which is very unfavorable for the recovery of brain function after resuscitation. Therefore, the 2010 AHA resuscitation guidelines recommend that normal ventilation function should still be maintained. During mechanical ventilation, excessive ventilation with high airway pressure and large tidal volume should be avoided (the appropriate tidal volume is $6 sim 8 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg}$) to reduce the resulting lung damage, cerebral ischemia and adverse effects on cardiac function. {II. Maintain hemodynamic stability} Hemodynamic status and degree of brain damage are two decisive factors affecting survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After cardiac arrest, even if spontaneous circulation is restored, hemodynamic instability often occurs. The cause should be evaluated from three aspects: cardiac preload, afterload and cardiac function. Because tissue ischemia and hypoxia lead to increased permeability of vascular walls, the body fluid in the blood vessels shifts to the interstitial tissue, which may cause decreased vascular tension and metabolic acidosis leading to vasodilation, resulting in absolute or relative hypovolemia. Ischemia-reperfusion and defibrillation can cause myocardial stunning or dysfunction, and lead to refractory low cardiac output syndrome. Therefore, after the restoration of spontaneous circulation, monitoring of vital signs should be strengthened to guide treatment. Generally speaking, body fluids should be properly supplemented after resuscitation. Artificial colloid fluids are very important for maintaining intravascular volume and plasma osmotic pressure. Vasoactive drugs should be used in combination to maintain ideal blood pressure, cardiac output and tissue perfusion. It is generally believed that it is ideal to maintain a mean arterial pressure of $ geqslant 65 mathrm{mmHg}$ and $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2} geqslant 70 %$. For patients with persistent hypotension or arrhythmia, etiological treatment should be considered, such as acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, etc., and appropriate treatment measures or interventional treatment should be taken. {III. Prevention and treatment of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or failure} Ischemia-reperfusion injury is the main cause of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ischemia and hypoxia can lead to tissue oxygen metabolism disorders, including reduced oxygen delivery and tissue oxygen utilization disorders; ischemia and reperfusion can trigger the release of a large number of oxygen free radicals in the body, and steady-state molecular oxygen is converted into extremely unstable oxygen free radicals; oxygen free radicals react with cell components, causing lipid peroxidation, increased biomembrane permeability, enzyme system damage, and changes in cell genetic information, which can lead to disorder in cell structure, metabolism, and function; coupled with the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells, endothelial cell damage and dysfunction. Ultimately, organ microcirculation disorders and parenchymal cell damage can be caused, causing MODS. Although cardiac arrest lasts only a few minutes, patients can have multiple organ dysfunction for hours or even days after resuscitation. This is the consequence of ischemia and hypoxia caused by insufficient tissue cell perfusion, also known as post-arrest syndrome. Clinical manifestations include: metabolic acidosis, decreased cardiac output, liver and kidney dysfunction, acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc. The dysfunction or failure of a certain organ of the body often affects the recovery of other organ functions; the abnormality of peripheral organ function (such as hypotension, ventilation dysfunction, etc.) will undoubtedly cause pathological changes in brain tissue. Therefore, hypoxic brain injury is actually a component of post-resuscitation multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or multiple organ failure (MOF). If the peripheral organ function cannot be kept intact, it is difficult to effectively prevent and treat hypoxic brain injury. Therefore, in the prevention and treatment of post-resuscitation multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or failure, the first thing to do is to maintain the stability of respiration (see respiratory management) and circulatory function after resuscitation, so that hemodynamics is in the best state, and at the same time, closely monitor urine volume, blood and urine osmotic pressure and electrolyte concentration to prevent the occurrence of renal failure. {IV. Cerebral resuscitation} The purpose of resuscitation is not only to restore and stabilize the patient's autonomous circulation and respiration, but also to restore central nervous function. The measures taken to prevent and treat ischemic brain damage after cardiac arrest are called cerebral resuscitation. Cerebral resuscitation is actually an important part of post-resuscitation treatment. {(I) Pathophysiology of global cerebral ischemia} Although human brain tissue accounts for only $2%$ of body weight by weight, cerebral blood flow accounts for 15%-20%$ of cardiac output, oxygen demand accounts for $20%-25%$, and glucose consumption accounts for $65%$. It can be seen that the metabolic rate of brain tissue is high and oxygen consumption is large, but the oxygen and energy reserves are very limited. When the brain is completely ischemic for 10-15 seconds, the brain's oxygen reserves are almost consumed; after 20 seconds, spontaneous and induced brain electrical activities stop, and the cell membrane ion spring function begins to fail; within 5 minutes, the brain's glucose and glycogen reserves and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are exhausted. In patients with complete cerebral ischemia for more than 5-7 minutes, multiple and focal morphological changes of cerebral tissue ischemia are found. However, when the autonomous circulation function is restored and the brain tissue is reperfused, this ischemic change continues to develop. Irreversible damage to nerve cells occurs after cerebral reperfusion, followed by cerebral congestion, cerebral edema and continuous low perfusion. As a result, brain cells continue to be ischemic and hypoxic, leading to cell degeneration and necrosis, which is called cerebral reperfusion injury. The pathological changes from ischemia to complete necrosis of brain cells are very complicated. Some people have observed that after 5 minutes of cardiac arrest, when the blood perfusion of the brain is restored at normal pressure, multifocal \"no reflow phenomenon\" can be seen, which may be related to capillary blockage caused by factors such as red blood cell aggregation and vascular spasm. Brain cells can release substances that are harmful to cells due to ischemia and hypoxia, leading to brain cell edema. It is generally believed that at room temperature {Chapter 20 Cardiopulmonary and Brain Resuscitation}, brain cells can be subjected to $4 sim 6$ minutes of complete ischemia and hypoxia, which can cause irreversible damage; but if there is even a small perfusion, the survival time of brain cells can be significantly extended. Therefore, the key to successful resuscitation is to establish effective artificial circulation immediately during the initial resuscitation.\n",
      "{(II) Measures for brain resuscitation} The task of brain resuscitation is to improve cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and prevent the occurrence of secondary brain injury. Necrotic brain tissue cannot regenerate, but the process and evolution of brain injury are not limited to the stage of complete brain ischemia; after the systemic circulation is restored, the pathological process in the brain continues to evolve; pathological factors outside the brain can also cause perfusion disorder of brain tissue and aggravate the development of cerebral edema. includegraphics[max width= textwidth, center]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-215} In other words, after the circulation is restored, there are still many factors inside and outside the brain that can cause secondary brain injury. So far, there is still a lack of evidence for effective treatment of primary hypoxic brain injury, but it is still possible to prevent and treat secondary injury. begin{enumerate} item Controlled hypothermia therapy Chinese scholars have established the benefits of hypothermia on brain resuscitation in the early 1960s. Since the late 1980s, research on hypothermia has made people increasingly aware that hypothermia is an important part of comprehensive brain resuscitation treatment. Because hypothermia can reduce the oxygen demand of brain cells, thereby maintaining the balance of brain oxygen supply and demand, it has a protective or therapeutic effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Studies have shown that every $1^{circ} mathrm{C}$ decrease in body temperature can reduce brain metabolic rate by 5%-6%, cerebral blood flow by about $6.7%$, and pre-intracerebral pressure by $5.5%$. This is very beneficial for preventing and treating brain edema and intracerebral hypertension after resuscitation. However, whole-body hypothermia can also bring about some adverse stress reactions, such as chills, myocardial depression, and effects on coagulation. Clinical and experimental research data show that mild hypothermia and moderate hypothermia are beneficial to the recovery of neurological function after cardiac arrest resuscitation. The results of multi-center, large-sample clinical studies from Europe and Australia are of great significance. The results of European studies have shown that after cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation is restored to spontaneous circulation after resuscitation, the implementation of $32 sim 34^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ hypothermia for 24 hours has significantly better neurological recovery rate and mortality rate than the normothermia group after 6 months ($55%$ vs $39%, 41%$ vs $55%$). Australian studies believe that after cardiac arrest outside the hospital is restored to spontaneous circulation after resuscitation, the implementation of $33^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ hypothermia for 12 hours has a neurological recovery rate of $48.8%$, which is significantly better than the normothermia group ($26.5%)$. However, in clinical practice, the indications for therapeutic hypothermia after resuscitation, the start time of cooling, the time to reach the target temperature and the duration, the degree of cooling and the method, etc., still need further study. end{enumerate} (1) Indications: Hypothermia has a protective effect on the brain and other organ functions. Hypothermia treatment is recommended for patients who remain in a coma after the recovery of spontaneous circulation from cardiac arrest, that is, those who do not respond to verbal commands. However, it cannot be assumed that all patients with cardiac arrest must be cooled. It is generally believed that for patients whose cardiac arrest does not exceed 3 to 4 minutes, their nervous system functions can recover quickly on their own, and hypothermia treatment is not necessary; for patients whose circulation arrest is too long, resulting in severe hypoxia of the central nervous system and a flaccid state, hypothermia cannot improve their functions. Therefore, for patients with a long cardiac arrest time (>4 minutes), who are still in a coma after the recovery of spontaneous circulation, or whose body temperature rises rapidly and whose muscle tension increases, and whose circulation stabilizes after treatment, hypothermia treatment should be started as soon as possible. If the duration of cardiac arrest cannot be determined, the patient should be closely observed. If the patient has not recovered consciousness and shows a trend of rising body temperature, or begins to show muscle tension and spasm, cooling should be started immediately. If cooling is not started until the body temperature reaches its peak or convulsion occurs, it may be too late and the therapeutic effect may be unsatisfactory. (2) Time to start cooling: It is not completely clear whether the time to start cooling after cardiac arrest has an impact on the recovery of brain function. Research results from Europe and Australia show that the prognosis is better when cooling is started within 2 hours or about 8 hours after the recovery of spontaneous circulation than in the normothermic group. The experience of Chinese scholars is that cooling is most effective in reducing intracranial pressure, reducing cerebral edema and reducing brain cell metabolism when it is started within about 3 hours after cerebral hypoxia occurs. The effect is significantly weakened after 8 hours. Therefore, clinical application of hypothermia treatment should be started as early as possible. (3) Extent and duration of cooling: Hypothermia refers to a body temperature below $35^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, which is divided into mild hypothermia $ left(35 sim 32^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$, moderate hypothermia $ left(32 sim 28^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$, deep hypothermia $ left(28 sim 20^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$ and hyperthermia $ left(<20^{ circ} mathrm{C} right)$. The extent of cooling may vary from patient to patient. The temperature should be reduced to a level that allows the patient to take the minimum dose of sedatives to suppress muscle spasms and maintain stable breathing and blood pressure. To achieve this goal, mild hypothermia is sufficient in most cases; moderate hypothermia is required in some cases to produce therapeutic effects. However, a body temperature below $30^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ may cause serious arrhythmias. When the body temperature is above $30^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, ventricular fibrillation rarely occurs; when the body temperature is below $28^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation increases significantly. Therefore, when implementing moderate hypothermia, close monitoring should be carried out to ensure that the fluctuation of body temperature does not exceed the range of $ pm 2^{ circ} mathrm{C}$. Once hypothermia treatment begins, it should be continued until the patient recovers consciousness, especially hearing, and then gradually (within 2 to 3 days) rewarming. Some people can fully recover consciousness after 24 hours; if they fail to recover within 24 hours, hypothermia can be continued for 72 hours. Clinically, there are also patients with longer duration of hypothermia (>5 days), but the prognosis of patients is not good. The 2010 AHA resuscitation guidelines recommend that mild hypothermia (34 to 32°C) should be administered for 12 sim 24 hours to adult patients who have recovered spontaneous circulation after CPR but are still unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. This type of hypothermia treatment is also beneficial for patients with other arrhythmias or in-hospital cardiac arrest. During hypothermia treatment, the patient's response should be closely observed, but it is not appropriate to subjectively guess whether the patient's consciousness has recovered, and it is even more inappropriate to reduce the degree of sedation or raise the body temperature prematurely to observe whether the patient's consciousness has recovered. The use of sedatives should be continued until the body temperature returns to normal. (4) Methods: Although there are many hypothermia treatment methods, there is no ideal method. Intravascular cooling devices with automatic feedback can maintain the target temperature more stably, but they are not widely used in clinical practice due to their invasiveness and complex operation. At present, the most commonly used cooling method is surface cooling, which uses a cooling blanket or ice packs placed on the large blood vessels on the surface of the body for cooling. Although the surface cooling method is relatively slow, as long as it is done carefully, the body temperature can generally be reduced to the target temperature within 2 hours. According to my country's research on comprehensive treatment of focused hypothermia of the head and experience in clinical brain resuscitation, if \"early cooling\" can be performed and \"ice cap\" is used for focused hypothermia of the head at the same time, it may be more conducive to brain protection. The cooling process can be divided into two stages: induction and maintenance. The former refers to the period from the beginning of cooling to the body temperature reaching the target temperature; the latter refers to maintaining the body temperature at the target temperature. During hypothermia treatment, it is very important to continuously monitor the core body temperature. Commonly used body temperature monitoring methods are esophageal thermometers, bladder thermometers (for those with urine), blood temperature (if a floating catheter has been placed) or tympanic membrane temperature. The cold reaction should be minimized during the induction period and should be completed in the shortest time. The strength of the cold reaction depends on the degree of suppression of the central nervous system. In cases of deep coma, although no additional measures are taken, there may be no obvious cold reaction, but most patients still need to be given a certain amount of central nervous system depressants or even muscle relaxants to control the cold reaction. {2. Promote cerebral blood perfusion} (1) Increase mean arterial pressure: After cardiac arrest, after the brain perfusion is restored at normal pressure, multifocal \"no reperfusion phenomenon\" can still be seen. During the ischemic period, due to the accumulation of tissue metabolic products and the transfer of $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the automatic regulation mechanism of cerebral blood flow is damaged. The perfusion of ischemic brain tissue mainly depends on the level of cerebral perfusion pressure or arterial pressure. In response to this phenomenon, temporary hypertension and blood dilution can be used to increase cerebral perfusion pressure and improve brain tissue perfusion. Therefore, some people advocate that blood pressure should be controlled slightly higher than the baseline level immediately after the restoration of autonomous circulation, and maintained for $5 sim 10$ minutes. Afterwards, blood pressure should be maintained at a normal to high level by supplementing volume or using vasoactive drugs. (2) Reduce intracerebral pressure: Cerebral blood flow depends on the level of cerebral perfusion pressure, which is the difference between mean arterial pressure and intracerebral pressure. Therefore, in addition to maintaining appropriate blood pressure, intracerebral pressure should be reduced and cerebral edema should be prevented and treated to improve cerebral perfusion pressure. Dehydration, hypothermia and the use of adrenocortical hormones are still effective measures to prevent and treat acute cerebral edema and reduce intracerebral pressure. Ideal dehydration treatment is mainly to reduce intracellular fluid, followed by extracellular fluid and intravascular fluid. However, the order of clinical dehydration treatment is completely opposite. The first thing to be affected is the intravascular fluid, followed by the change of interstitial fluid, and the change of intracellular fluid occurs last. Therefore, during the dehydration process, it is necessary to strictly maintain normal blood volume and appropriately supplement colloidal fluid to maintain blood volume and plasma colloidal osmotic pressure at a normal to high level. This may dehydrate the intracellular and interstitial tissues while maintaining normal intravascular volume. At the same time, dehydration should be completed by increasing the output, and the output should not be too restricted, especially the output should not be lower than the metabolic needs. During dehydration, the plasma colloidal pressure should be maintained at no less than $15 mathrm{mmHg}$ (plasma albumin $30 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$ or more), and the blood osmotic pressure should be maintained at no less than $280 ~ $330 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. The drugs used for dehydration can be selected from renal tubular diuretics (such as saxamidine) or osmotic diuretics (such as mannitol) according to the clinical situation. The effect of osmotic diuretics is relatively mild and long-lasting, and can be used as the main drug for dehydration treatment. Plasma albumin is beneficial for maintaining plasma colloidal osmotic pressure and has a good diuretic effect. It is one of the commonly used drugs for brain resuscitation. It is estimated that in cases where cardiac arrest lasts more than $3 sim 4$ minutes, diuresis can be started after breathing and circulation are restored to stability. The development of cerebral edema generally reaches its peak on the $3 sim 4$ day, so dehydration treatment can continue for $4 sim 5$ days. (3) Improve cerebral microcirculation: Maintaining Hct at $30% sim 35%$ through appropriate blood dilution can reduce blood viscosity, improve cerebral microcirculation, facilitate the reconstruction of microcirculatory blood flow in the brain, improve cerebral blood perfusion, and promote the recovery of neurological function. However, excessive blood dilution\n",
      "{Chapter 20 Cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation} It is detrimental to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and should be avoided. (4) Blood sugar control: Increased blood sugar concentration can significantly aggravate cerebral ischemic damage, because increased blood sugar can increase lactic acid production during cerebral ischemia and aggravate brain damage. Therefore, during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, high blood sugar should be controlled regardless of the cause (diabetes, excessive sugar infusion, stress response, use of corticosteroids, etc.). However, when using insulin to control high blood sugar, hypoglycemia must be avoided, because hypoglycemia itself can cause irreversible brain damage. There is still no consensus on the level of blood sugar control. The current view is that in order to avoid hypoglycemia and its harm, it is recommended to control blood sugar at $144 sim 180 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{dl}(8 sim$ $10 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L})$, and it is not recommended to control blood sugar at $80 sim 110 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{dl}(4.4 sim 6.1 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L})$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Although there have been many studies on the protective measures of hypoxic brain cells by drug therapy, there is still a lack of effective clinical applications. Although the protective effect of sodium thiopental and other barbiturates on brain cells has attracted widespread attention, it is now known that this is not the case after verification by multiple academic centers. However, active protection of brain cells is still the most fundamental issue in brain resuscitation, and it is still worth continuous exploration and research. end{enumerate} (1) Calcium channel blocker (CCB): Its brain protection effect is proposed based on the theory of intracellular calcium overload. Theoretically, $ mathrm{CEB}$ has the function of stabilizing calcium channels, blocking the influx of $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and preventing various negative reactions caused by the increase of intracellular $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, such as activating phospholipases, promoting the release of free fatty acids, and inducing the production of oxygen free radicals. However, its clinical application still needs further research. (2) Free radical scavenger (FRS): During hypoxia and reperfusion, a large increase in free radicals can react with intracellular $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and various unsaturated fatty acids, leading to damage to cell membranes and mitochondria and their dysfunction, and even cell necrosis. The application of FRS can eliminate its highly reactive activity. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase can convert superoxide anions $ left( mathrm{O}_{2}^{-} right)$ and hydrogen peroxide $ left( mathrm{H}_{2} mathrm{O}_{2} right)$ into water. However, its clinical application value is still under study. (3) Adrenal cortex hormone: In theory, it is beneficial to brain resuscitation, but there are many controversies in clinical application. Experimental studies have shown that adrenal cortex hormone can relieve edema of glial cells, which is the theoretical basis for clinical application. Although the preventive effect of adrenal cortex hormone on nerve tissue edema seems to be more obvious, its effect on brain edema that has already formed seems to be questionable. Therefore, it can only be considered as an auxiliary measure and cannot play a major role. It is generally recommended to start medication as early as possible and stop taking it after $3 sim 4$ days to avoid causing adverse complications. {(III) Brain death} Brain death refers to the irreversible loss of all functions of the whole brain (including the brainstem), especially the loss of brainstem function. The loss of brainstem function is very important in the diagnosis of brain death and must be absolutely confirmed. Among patients in clinical coma, some can recover, but there may be varying degrees of functional impairment, while others are in a state of stubborn coma. Among stubborn comatose patients, some patients have lost the function of the cerebral cortex, while the brainstem function still exists and they can still breathe independently, which is called a vegetative state (commonly known as a vegetative state). If treated or cared for properly, a vegetative state can live for a considerable period of time. Those who also lose brainstem function at the same time, manifesting as coma and cessation of spontaneous breathing, are brain dead. Since the diagnostic criteria for brain death formulated by Harvard Medical School were published in 1968, people have gradually accepted this new concept of death and used it as a new standard for judging human death. The Royal College of Physicians of the United Kingdom issued a memorandum on brain death in 1976, stating that brainstem death is a necessary and important component of brain death, and brain death is equivalent to clinical death. However, there is no unified brain death diagnostic standard in the world. Academic institutions or groups in various countries formulate their own brain death diagnostic standards based on relevant guidelines from the United States and the United Kingdom and the social background of their regions. my country formulated the \"Chinese Brain Death Diagnostic Standards\" (draft) in 2002. It is generally believed that the diagnosis of brain death must have the following four clinical indications: (1) complete loss of consciousness (deep coma) and no voluntary movements; (2) no body movement response to pain stimulation, including the decerebrate state and the decorticate state, but the patient's spinal reflexes may still exist; (3) disappearance of brainstem reflexes, including pupil light response, corneal reflex, oculovestibular reflex and cough reflex; (4) complete cessation of spontaneous breathing, when $ mathrm{Pa}_{2}$ rises to $ mathrm{mmHg}$ (or $ mathrm{mmHg}$) and lasts for 3 minutes, spontaneous breathing has not recovered. {Chapter 21 Clinical Application of Sedation} With the development of medicine and its auxiliary technologies (fiber optics, lasers and endoscopes), the previous surgeries with great trauma and long duration have been transformed into less invasive and shorter operations, such as interventional treatment of aneurysms and coronary heart disease, extracorporeal lithotripsy and various endoscopic treatments. These changes have put forward new requirements for clinical anesthesia, which is not only to help patients go through the diagnosis and treatment operations safely and comfortably, but also to wake up and recover as soon as possible. Therefore, various drugs and their antagonists that are fast and effective, can accurately predict the duration of action, have no accumulation and have few adverse reactions have been widely used in clinical practice, and various sedation techniques have also been rapidly developed, such as monitoring anesthesia technology, daytime sedation technology, and radiation-mediated sedation technology. {Section 1 Physiological Effects of Sedation} The physiological effects of sedation depend on the degree of sedation. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) divides the degree of sedation into: minimal sedation (anti-anxiety), moderate sedation (hypnosis), deep sedation-analgesia and general anesthesia. Minimal sedation (anxiolysis) means that the sedative can suppress the patient's cognitive function, but the patient can respond normally to verbal commands, and has almost no effect on respiratory and circulatory functions. Moderate sedation (hypnosis) means that the sedative moderately suppresses the patient's state of consciousness, but can still respond to verbal commands, and his respiratory and circulatory functions can usually be maintained. Deep sedation and analgesia means that the sedative deeply suppresses the patient's consciousness, making it difficult to wake up but can respond to painful stimuli. His respiratory function may require auxiliary support measures, and his circulatory function can usually be maintained. General anesthesia means that the drug causes the patient to lose consciousness, cannot be awakened, has no response to painful stimuli, requires auxiliary support for respiratory function, and may be inhibited to a certain extent. begin{enumerate} item Effects on the central nervous system Sedatives are a class of drugs that have an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system and can cause sedation and near-physiological sleep. Small doses can produce sedation, while larger doses can produce hypnosis or even anesthetic effects. The effects of sedatives on the central nervous system are manifested in the effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Most sedatives can cause a decrease in brain electrical activity as the dose increases. Therefore, electroencephalograms (including BIS, abstract index, etc.) are often used clinically to monitor the patient's sedation level. However, in general, the degree of inhibition of the central nervous system by sedatives is evaluated clinically by the patient's response to stimulation, such as the Ramsay score (Table 21-1). end{enumerate} Table 21-1 Ramsay score begin{center} begin{tabular}{cl} hline Score & multicolumn{1}{c}{State Description} hline 1 & Anxious, restless 2 & Cooperative, oriented, quiet 3 & Responds to commands 4 & Sleepy, responds quickly to light touch between eyebrows or loud calls 5 & Drowsy, slow to light touch between eyebrows or loud calls 6 & Drowsy, no response hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Effects on the respiratory system Most sedatives can dose-dependently inhibit the respiratory center, resulting in a decrease in the patient's tidal volume and minute ventilation, a decrease in the response to hypoxia and to increased $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and even transient apnea, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Clinically, the degree of inhibition of the respiratory system by sedatives can be evaluated by observing the patient's ventilation/breathing pattern, and the dosage of sedatives can be adjusted (Table 21-2). For patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and some people with potential ventilation dysfunction, sedatives should be used with caution, and artificial airways (endotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask, etc.) should be established when necessary. end{enumerate} Table 21-2 Ventilation/breathing methods begin{center} begin{tabular}{ll} hline S & Completely spontaneous breathing A & Spontaneous breathing with intermittent assisted breathing C & Manual ventilation OA & Oropharyngeal airway LMA & Laryngeal mask hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Effects on the cardiovascular system Most sedatives can inhibit cardiovascular function in a dose-dependent manner, leading to changes in heart rate and blood pressure. This effect on cardiovascular function is manifested in the effects on myocardial contractility, systemic vascular resistance, sympathetic nerve activity, etc. Therefore, the person performing the sedation must monitor heart rate and blood pressure, and if necessary, supplement fluids and apply vasoactive drugs. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Commonly used sedatives and antagonists} The ideal sedative should have the following conditions: rapid onset, predictable dose-effect; short half-life, no accumulation; small inhibition of respiration and circulation; metabolic mode independent of liver and kidney function; predictable anxiolytic and amnesic effects; rapid recovery after drug withdrawal; low price, etc. The sedatives and analgesics commonly used in clinical practice are mostly the same as general anesthetics, such as propofol, etomidate, morphine, fentanyl, etc. This chapter only introduces drugs that are not introduced in Chapter 5 on general anesthesia. {(I) Benzodiazepine sedatives and antagonists} begin{enumerate} item Midazolam has typical benzodiazepine pharmacological activity, with anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant and central muscle relaxant effects, and can produce temporary anterograde amnesia. Its action intensity is $2 sim 3$ times that of diazepam, and its plasma clearance rate is higher than that of diazepam, so it has a rapid onset, a short duration, and relatively rapid awakening, and is suitable for the treatment of acute agitated patients. end{enumerate} After midazolam binds to the benzodiazepine receptor, $ gamma$-aminobutyric acid is released into the synaptic interstitium, activating the chloride ion channel of the postsynaptic membrane. The influx of chloride ions leads to excessive polarization of the postsynaptic membrane, inhibiting the conduction of excitation. It has a mild inhibitory effect on circulation, lowering blood pressure and reflexively increasing heart rate. It also has a mild inhibition on breathing, reduces tidal volume, increases respiratory rate, shortens exhalation time, but does not affect functional residual capacity. The inhibition of circulation and breathing is related to the dosage and injection speed. Too fast injection or too large a dose can cause obvious respiratory depression and blood pressure drop. Continuous slow intravenous infusion can effectively reduce its side effects. Long-term use of midazolam will have an accumulation and prolonged sedative effect, which is particularly obvious in patients with renal failure; some patients may also develop tolerance. Propofol, cimetidine, erythromycin and other cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors can significantly slow down the metabolic rate of midazolam.\n",
      "{2. Diazepam, also known as Valium, has anti-anxiety, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects.} The mechanism of action of diazepam is to selectively excite the benzodiazepine receptors of the central nervous system, increase the inhibitory effect of the central inhibitory neurotransmitter $ gamma $ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the central nervous system, weaken the facilitation effect of the brainstem reticular formation on the spinal reflex, and a larger dose can directly inhibit the multi-synaptic reflex on the spinal cord, playing an anticonvulsant role; it can also block the awakening brain waves caused by stimulating the brainstem reticular formation, and inhibit the after-discharge of the evoked potentials of the hippocampus and amygdala of the limbic system, thereby producing sedative, hypnotic and anti-anxiety effects. Diazepam has antianxiety and anticonvulsant effects, and the effects are dose-related and vary according to the route of administration. Large doses can cause certain respiratory depression and blood pressure drop. A single dose of diazepam has the characteristics of rapid onset and rapid awakening, and can be used to treat patients with acute agitation. However, its metabolites, nordiazepam and noroxydiazepam, have similar pharmacological activity to diazepam and have a long half-life. Therefore, repeated use can lead to accumulation and prolong the sedative effect. Precautions: (1) When intravenous injection is too fast or the dose is too high, it may cause adverse reactions such as hypotension and apnea; (2) It may cause pain at the injection site and local phlebitis; (3) It should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma, myasthenia gravis and liver dysfunction. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines. Due to its special structure-activity relationship, flumazenil competitively binds to benzodiazepine receptors, reduces the activity of receptor complex proteins, reduces the release of $ gamma$-aminobutyric acid, closes chloride ion channels, and releases inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, thereby antagonizing the central nervous system sedative effect of benzodiazepines. Flumazenil can make patients wake up as soon as possible after surgery, improving postoperative safety; it has little effect on circulation, respiration, and liver and kidney function. However, attention should be paid to the differences in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic between the two, so as not to endanger life due to re-sedation after antagonism; be alert to the agitation caused by excessive antagonism in patients with long-term sedation. end{enumerate} {(II) $ alpha_{2}$ adrenergic receptor agonists} $ alpha_{2}$ receptor agonists have strong sedative and antianxiety effects; they have certain analgesic effects and can reduce the dosage of opioids; they have anti-sympathetic effects and can cause bradycardia and (or) hypotension. At present, dexmedetomidine is widely used in clinical practice. Due to its high selectivity for $ alpha_{2}$ receptors, dexmedetomidine is currently the only drug that has both sedative and analgesic effects, and it has no obvious cardiovascular inhibition and rebound effect after drug withdrawal. Dexmedetomidine stimulates the brainstem locus coeruleus (responsible for regulating wakefulness and sleep), the area with the most dense $ alpha_{2}$ receptors in the central nervous system, to induce and maintain the natural non-motor eye movement (NREM) sleep state, producing sedative, hypnotic and anti-anxiety effects. This sedative state can be awakened by stimulation or language, and there is no respiratory depression during the sedation process. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are more comfortable and can be awakened during surgery. Dexmedetomidine has a good analgesic effect, acting on the $ alpha_{2}$ adrenergic receptors of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes of interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, causing the cells to hyperpolarize and inhibiting the conduction of pain signals to the brain. It can also produce analgesic effects at the central level. After binding to the $ alpha_{2}$ receptors of the brainstem locus coeruleus, it terminates the conduction of pain signals; inhibits the release of substance P and other noxious peptides in the presynaptic membrane of the descending medulla oblongata-spinal cord noradrenergic pathway, producing analgesic effects. Dexmedetomidine can also directly block peripheral nerve $ mathrm{C}$ fibers and $ mathrm{A} alpha$ fibers, producing concentration-dependent reversible inhibition. Clinical application: The loading dose for adults is $1 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg}$, slowly (>10 minutes) intravenously. The maintenance dose is $0.2 sim 0.7 mu mathrm{g} /$ $( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$ continuously intravenously. {(III) Phenothiazines} begin{enumerate} item Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine drug that mainly inhibits the ascending reticular activation system of the brainstem and blocks central dopamine receptors, producing tranquilizer and antipsychotic effects; inhibits the medullary emetic chemoreceptor area and vomiting center, producing antiemetic effects; inhibition of the hypothalamus produces autonomic nerve blockade, which reduces peripheral vascular resistance and vasodilation, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, but an increase in tissue perfusion; it has no significant effect on myocardial contractility and electrocardiogram, and has no significant inhibitory effect on respiration. Currently, it is rarely used clinically, mainly for the treatment of schizophrenia, antiemetic, hypothermic anesthesia and artificial hibernation, and is used in combination with analgesics to treat severe pain in advanced cancer. The classic formula is Artificial Hibernation I: chlorpromazine $50 mathrm{mg}$, isoproterenol $50 mathrm{mg}$, and pethidine $100 mathrm{mg}$. item Promethazine, also known as phenergan, is a phenothiazine antihistamine. Its inhibitory effect on the central nervous system is similar to that of chlorpromazine, but not as obvious as that of chlorpromazine. It is easier to enter the brain tissue, so it has a significant sedative effect; it is a histamine $ mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptor antagonist, has anticholinergic effects, prevents and treats motion sickness and antiemetics; it can cause a slight decrease in blood pressure accompanied by tachycardia, and has no significant effect on cardiac output; it has no significant inhibitory effect on respiration, can reduce bronchial secretion and saliva, and relax bronchial smooth muscles, so it can prevent cough and bronchial spasm caused by anesthesia; it has little effect on liver and kidney function. It is mainly used in the clinic to treat allergic diseases. It is often used as a pre-anesthetic drug in clinical anesthesia, and has good sedative and antiemetic effects. It is often used in combination with pethidine to assist epidural block. It is also one of the main ingredients of hibernation mixture. Usage and dosage: Oral administration: $12.5 sim 25 mathrm{mg}$ each time; intramuscular injection or intravenous drip: $25 sim 50 mathrm{mg}$ each time. end{enumerate} {(IV) Butyrophenones} Delirium must be treated promptly. Generally, sedatives are used sparingly to avoid aggravating the disturbance of consciousness. However, patients with agitation or other mental symptoms must be given medication to control them and prevent accidents. Improper use of sedatives and analgesics may aggravate delirium symptoms. begin{enumerate} item Haloperidol has similar effects to chlorpromazine, with strong and lasting antipsychotic effects, about 50 times that of chlorpromazine. Its mechanism of action is to block dopamine receptors and adrenaline $ alpha$ receptors, but its antihypertensive effect is not obvious. It has a strong anti-vomiting effect and has a significant effect on intractable vomiting and persistent hiccups. It is a commonly used drug for the clinical treatment of delirium. Side effects include: extrapyramidal symptoms; it can cause dose-related QT prolongation and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with a history of heart disease are more likely to experience such side effects. Haloperidol has a long half-life, and patients with acute delirium need to be given a loading dose to achieve rapid onset of action. Item Droperidol is similar to haloperidol, and mainly has inhibitory effects on the subcortical center, limbic system, pyramidal system and hypothalamus; it has a rapid onset of action, and the duration of action is less than 24 hours; its tranquilizing effect is equivalent to 3 times that of haloperidol, and it has an antiemetic effect; it can enhance the effect of analgesics, and combined with strong analgesics can produce a sedative and anesthetic state in patients, which is called neuroleptic analgesia. It can be used as a pre-anesthetic drug, and has good anti-stress and antiemetic effects. Side effects: Extrapyramidal symptoms may occur, with a lower incidence than haloperidol. It is contraindicated for patients with extrapyramidal reactions. It should be used with caution in children, adolescents, elderly patients and patients with impaired liver function. end{enumerate} {Section 3 Clinical Application of Sedation} {I. Indications for Sedation} begin{enumerate} item Fearful and anxious patients Patients have fear and anxiety symptoms regarding the diagnosis and treatment measures, including clinical symptoms (such as palpitations, sweating) and tension. item Agitation and delirium Agitation is an irritable state accompanied by constant movements, or an extremely anxious state accompanied by struggling movements. Delirium is a transient state of confusion caused by various reasons. The clinical characteristics of delirium are the occurrence of impaired consciousness and cognitive function changes in a short period of time. Decreased clarity of consciousness or decreased level of awakening is the key to diagnosis. The cause of agitation or delirium should be discovered in time, the physiological disorder should be actively corrected, and relative sedation should be given at the same time. item Stimulating diagnostic and therapeutic procedures Stimulating diagnostic and therapeutic procedures often bring physical and psychological pain to patients, such as endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, etc., and analgesia and sedation are used to reduce or inhibit the patient's physical and psychological stress response. item Uncooperative patients Children and patients with mental disorders are unable to cooperate with diagnosis and treatment and often require sedation. item Patients with sleep disorders Sleep disorders may delay tissue repair and reduce cellular immune function. Types of sleep disorders include: insomnia, excessive sleep, and sleep-wake rhythm disorders. Many hospitalized patients often have insomnia or sleep-wake rhythm disorders and need analgesia and sedation to improve sleep quality. end{enumerate} {II. Goals of sedation} Sedation is a treatment method that helps patients overcome anxiety, induce sleep and forgetfulness on the basis of eliminating pain factors. Its goals are: begin{enumerate} item Eliminate or reduce the patient's pain and discomfort, and reduce adverse stimulation and excessive excitement of the sympathetic nerves. item Improve sleep, induce forgetfulness, and reduce or eliminate the patient's memory of the pain during the examination and treatment. item Reduce or eliminate the patient's anxiety, agitation, or even delirium, and prevent the patient's unconscious behavior from interfering with treatment. item Reduce the patient's metabolic rate and reduce their oxygen demand and consumption. end{enumerate} {III. Monitoring during sedation} The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) believes that the basic monitoring of sedation should be the same as that of general anesthesia, and must include: (1) Full-time monitoring by dedicated personnel; (2) Oxygenation monitoring, including clinical signs and $ mathrm{SpO}_{2}$; (3) Ventilation monitoring, including clinical signs and, if necessary, nasal cannula monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide $ left( mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2} right)$; (4) Circulation monitoring, including electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and heart rate; (5) Temperature monitoring. Sedation is generally performed by anesthesiologists and/or anesthesia nurses. The ASA's guidelines for non-anesthesiologists on sedation and analgesia point out that: Medical personnel who perform sedation operations must master the basic life support skills (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial respiration, etc.) during moderate and deep sedation; they must be familiar with the pharmacological properties of sedatives, analgesics and their antagonists. When performing deep sedation, they must master the techniques of opening the airway and performing positive pressure ventilation, including: (1) resuscitation measures and the use of various drugs and instruments; (2) endotracheal intubation and the use of ventilators; (3) the indications and timing of endotracheal extubation; and (4) the clinical significance of various monitoring indicators.\n",
      "{IV. Withdrawal criteria for sedation} begin{enumerate} item Withdrawal criteria for outpatient sedation patients The withdrawal criteria for outpatient sedation patients can be based on the modified postanesthetic discharge scoring (mPADS). The score includes five main indicators: (1) vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature; (2) walking ability and mental state; (3) degree of pain and nausea and vomiting; (4) degree of surgical bleeding; (5) fluid intake and output. Patients with a score of $ geqslant 9$ can be discharged accompanied by an adult (Table 21-3). end{enumerate} Table 21-3 Modified Post-Anesthesia Ambulatory Discharge Score (mPADS) begin{center} begin{tabular}{ccl} hline & score & multicolumn{1}{c}{change 1} hline Vital signs & 2 & Change no more than $20%$ of preoperative level Walking ability & 1 & Change in $20% of preoperative level sim 40%$ & 0 & Change more than $40%$ of preoperative level Nausea and vomiting level & 2 & Steady gait, no dizziness & 1 & Assisted walking & 0 & No walking ability or dizziness Pain level & 2 & Mild & 1 & Moderate & 0 & Severe Surgical bleeding & 2 & Mild & 1 & Moderate & 0 & Severe & 2 & Mild hline end{tabular} end{center} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Sedation monitoring medical staff withdrawal criteria The withdrawal criteria for medical personnel in sedation monitoring can be based on the Post-Anesthesia Recovery Score (modified Aldrete score), which provides an overall assessment of the patient's degree of awakening after sedation. Medical personnel can only leave the sedated patient if the score is $ geqslant 9$ (Table 21-4). end{enumerate} Table 21-4 Modified Aldrete Score begin{center} begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} hline & Table & Score hline multirow[t]{3}{*}{Motor function} & Able to move limbs and lift head as required & 2 hline & Able to move two limbs and lift head to a limited extent & 1 hline & Unable to move limbs or lift head as required & 0 hline multirow[t]{3}{*}{Respiratory function} & Able to breathe deeply and cough up sputum freely & 2 hline & Dyspnea & 1 hline & Asphyxia & 0 hline multirow[t]{3}{*}{Circulatory function} & Blood pressure fluctuations do not exceed $20 %$ of preoperative blood pressure & 2 hline & Blood pressure fluctuations are more than $20 %$ of preoperative blood pressure & 1 hline & Blood pressure fluctuations exceed 50 % of preoperative blood pressure & 0 hline multirow[t]{3}{*}{Consciousness} & fully awake & 2 hline & drowsiness, but responsive to stimulation & 1 hline & no response & 0 hline multirow[t]{3}{*}{Pulse blood saturation} & >92 % with air & 2 hline & >92 % with supplemental oxygen & 1 hline & <92 % with supplemental oxygen & 0 hline end{tabular} end{center}\n",
      "{V. Common sedation techniques} begin{enumerate} item Sedation of ICU patients Most ICU patients who are not mechanically ventilated need sedation treatment to reduce the occurrence of anxiety, agitation, delirium and sleep disorders. However, sedation treatment for such patients emphasizes \"moderation\". Both \"excessive\" and \"insufficient\" may cause harm to patients. Since ICU patients need to be sedated for a long time, they are required to retain spontaneous breathing, maintain basic physiological defense reflexes and sensory motor functions during sedation, and implement a daily awakening plan to assess their consciousness, sensory and motor functions. Because ICU patients often have organ dysfunction and use a variety of drugs and treatment methods, it is necessary to consider the interactions between the drugs used, changes in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics, and accumulation of drugs in the body. The degree of analgesia and sedation should be regularly judged and the type and dosage of drugs should be adjusted at any time. The assessment of pain level and consciousness state is the basis for analgesia and sedation, and it is also the guarantee for the safe application of analgesia/sedation treatment. end{enumerate} For short-term (~$ leqslant 3$ days) sedation, propofol and midazolam produce similar clinical sedative effects. However, propofol awakens faster after discontinuation of medication, and the time of extubation is significantly earlier than midazolam, but it fails to shorten the patient's stay in the ICU. Lorazepam has a slow onset of action and a long clearance time, which is prone to over-sedation. Therefore, propofol and midazolam are mainly used for short-term sedation in ICU patients. For long-term ( $>3$ days) sedation, propofol awakens faster and extubates earlier than midazolam. However, propofol is more likely to cause hypotension during the induction period, while midazolam is prone to respiratory depression. Midazolam can produce more amnesia during medication. High-dose sedatives for more than one week can cause drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms. The withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines include: restlessness, sleep disturbance, muscle spasms, myoclonus, inattention, frequent yawning, anxiety, tremor, nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, increased sensitivity to light and sound, abnormal sensations, delirium and eczema. Therefore, to prevent withdrawal symptoms, the drug should not be stopped suddenly, but should be gradually reduced in a planned manner. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Sedation of mechanically ventilated patients Mechanically ventilated patients often require adequate sedation/analgesia to reduce stress reactions; at the same time, treat the patient's tension, anxiety and restlessness, and improve the patient's tolerance to mechanical ventilation and other diagnostic and therapeutic operations. end{enumerate} The degree of sedation depends on the purpose of sedation, such as reducing anxiety, relieving pain or inhibiting respiratory drive. By adjusting the injection rate of the sedative, the ideal level of sedation can be achieved, so that the patient can have a certain degree of sleep and be easily awakened. The sedation level should be deepened when sleep is needed, and the dosage of sedatives should be reduced during the awakening period to restore the patient's sleep-wake cycle to normal. Excessive sedation can cause the patient to lose orientation and unstable cardiovascular function, and it is difficult to evacuate the ventilator. The sedative should be selected according to the expected time of mechanical ventilation, such as short-term (<24 hours) or long-term (>24 hours). For those who need short-term mechanical ventilation, it is best to use short-acting sedatives, such as midazolam or propofol, which are generally administered by continuous intravenous injection. Inappropriate excessive sedation treatment can delay the extubation time of endotracheal intubation, prolong the ICU stay, and increase the cost of treatment. Therefore, sedatives for mechanically ventilated patients can be used intermittently or adjusted on an \"as needed\" basis. They should be adjusted according to the principle of individualization and the needs of the patient to achieve the sedation goal, ultimately shorten the mechanical ventilation time and ICU stay, and enable patients to actively participate in and cooperate with treatment earlier. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) Conscious sedation is the minimal suppression of consciousness by pharmacological or non-pharmacological means, while the patient is able to maintain a patent airway and respond to stimulation or verbal commands. Later, the concept of \"conscious sedation\" has been replaced by monitored anesthesia care (MAC). MAC refers to the monitoring and sedation/analgesia of patients by an anesthesiologist while they are receiving local or regional anesthesia or without anesthesia. If the patient loses consciousness completely or cannot maintain a patent airway, it should be considered as general anesthesia. end{enumerate} MAC is not just about giving sedation, but professional monitoring of anesthesia during sedation to ensure the safety and comfort of the patient. Therefore, medical personnel who implement MAC should be qualified and have the ability to deal with airway obstruction, hypoventilation and hypotension, and be able to reduce the degree of sedation as needed. The monitoring criteria for MAC are the same as those for general anesthesia. The ASA stipulates that the basic monitoring criteria for MAC include at least the assessment of ventilation, oxygenation, circulation, and sedation levels, and emphasizes that the anesthesiologist must always be with the patient and be able to handle emergencies at any time. Patients undergoing surgery under MAC are usually not intubated, and it is difficult to measure $ mathrm{P}_{ mathrm{ET}} mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The most common and dangerous complication is inadequate ventilation. Therefore, the patient's chest movement range, respiratory rate, etc. should be closely observed. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Sedation for Day Surgery Day surgery (outpatient surgery) refers to patients undergoing elective surgery or invasive examinations in a hospital in a non-hospitalized manner. Generally, postoperative recovery needs to be completed in the hospital, but they do not stay in the hospital overnight. Advantages: (1) Shorten the appointment time for surgery; (2) Shorten the treatment cycle; (3) Reduce nosocomial infection of wounds; (4) Reduce the psychological pressure of patients (especially children); (5) Reduce postoperative complications; (6) Save medical expenses; (7) Save public medical resources. end{enumerate} Preoperative condition assessment: The patient's surgical and anesthesia risks should be assessed, including: (1) the patient's general condition and comorbidities; (2) the size of the surgical trauma; (3) the choice of anesthesia method; (4) the medical environment and nursing conditions after the patient leaves the hospital. Day surgery mostly selects ASA grade I and II patients. It is generally believed that patients with the following diseases are not suitable for day surgery: including: (1) Cardiovascular disease: such as patients with hypertension over 70 years old, patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, unstable angina within 6 months, patients with symptomatic ventricular embolism, patients with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, II-III degree atrioventricular block, patients taking digoxin or diuretics; (2) Respiratory disease: such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux, excessive obesity and sleep apnea, upper respiratory tract infection, especially children. Preoperative preparation: Short-acting benzodiazepines and anti-sympathetic drugs can provide satisfactory sedation, amnesia and antianxiety effects before surgery, and will not delay recovery time. It is reported that intravenous injection of midazolam $1 sim 3 mathrm{mg}$ or diazepam emulsion $2.5 sim 7.5 mathrm{mg}$ before surgery can improve the outcome of surgery. Normally, adults should not drink water for 2 hours and should not eat for 6 hours. $ mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists and metoclopramide can reduce the amount of residual gastric juice. Sedation method: For local anesthesia and regional blockade, moderate sedation can be given to ensure the safety and comfort of the patient. Generally, intravenous injection of midazolam $2 mathrm{mg}$ and propofol $25 sim 75 mu mathrm{g} / mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ can significantly enhance anterograde amnesia and anti-anxiety effects without prolonging the awakening period. Small doses of propofol can also be used as adjuvants with short-acting opioids such as remifentanil. Nerve block combined with sedation is beneficial to the patient's recovery. Many patients can use MAC instead of general anesthesia or spinal blockade. Postoperative recovery: Generally divided into three stages: (1) Early recovery, i.e., from the end of anesthesia to the patient's awakening from anesthesia, is the period of high incidence of post-anesthesia complications. The patient needs to lie flat and receive close monitoring and effective treatment; (2) Mid-recovery, i.e., from awakening to reaching the discharge criteria; (3) Late recovery, i.e., from discharge to full recovery. For day surgery patients, it is required that they can quickly recover to the mid-term state after the end of the surgery and the cessation of anesthesia. After an appropriate period of observation, they can meet the discharge criteria. However, in deciding whether a patient can be discharged, the standards must be strictly followed. According to the mPADS score of 9 or more and with an adult accompanying them, they are suitable for discharge. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Radiological interventional sedation technology Mainly refers to the sedation of patients undergoing imaging examinations or treatments in the radiology department or interventional department. Most adults can tolerate imaging examinations without sedatives, while therapeutic operations often require appropriate sedation, which can enable patients to comfortably tolerate diagnostic and treatment operations and ensure sufficient examination time. However, sedation techniques are mostly used for children and adults with claustrophobia, mental retardation, difficulty in communication and cooperation; patients with involuntary movements or inability to tolerate long periods of lying still; patients with critical conditions or severe injuries that make it difficult to maintain airway patency, who need close monitoring during diagnosis and treatment. Patients with severe allergic reactions to contrast agents also need the participation of anesthesiologists. end{enumerate} Features: Due to the limited space in the treatment room and the large number of medical examination equipment, anesthesiologists often find it difficult to get close to patients; during radiological examinations, anesthesiologists need to leave the treatment room and can only observe and monitor patients through observation windows or closed-circuit televisions; in a dark room, the patient's skin color, respiratory movements, anesthesia machines and monitors must be observed under appropriate lighting; treatment rooms often lack central gas supply systems, suction devices and exhaust gas exhaust systems; treatment rooms are often far away from operating rooms, and there are few opportunities for medical and nursing staff to cooperate with each other, which brings certain difficulties to the handling of emergency situations. Because patients often have other underlying diseases and are far away from the operating room during examinations and sedation, the implementation of sedation is more difficult. Therefore, MAC technique or endotracheal intubation general anesthesia is often used. The monitoring equipment and items for anesthesia outside the operating room should be the same as those in the operating room. Before sedation begins, oxygen supply facilities, suction devices, anesthesia and emergency equipment and drugs must be checked. After sedation begins, the monitoring values ​​must be carefully observed so that emergency situations can be discovered and handled in a timely manner. Patients after diagnosis and treatment should be closely monitored and sent to PACU if necessary. {VI. Complications and treatment of sedation} begin{enumerate} item Respiratory depression Respiratory depression is a common respiratory complication in sedated patients, manifested as hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and in severe cases, respiratory arrest may occur. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{Chapter 21 Clinical Application of Sedation} (1) Causes: (1) Patient factors: elderly, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and preoperative complications of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma and other respiratory diseases; (2) Drug factors: propofol, etopofol, opioids, etc.; (3) Surgical factors: upper abdominal surgery, neck surgery, gastroscopy, etc. (2) Treatment: (1) Keep the airway open; (2) Oxygen inhalation; (3) Use artificial respiration to restore effective alveolar ventilation and gas exchange; (4) Reduce the degree of sedation to avoid aggravating respiratory depression; (5) Use antagonist drugs, such as naloxone and flumazenil; (6) Perform endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation when necessary. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Circulatory depression Circulatory depression occurs when blood pressure drops by more than $20 %$ before sedation or systolic blood pressure drops below $80 mathrm{mmHg}$. end{enumerate} (1) Causes: (1) Hypovolemia; (2) Cardiogenic shock; (3) Anaphylactic shock; (4) Surgical factors; (5) Transfusion reaction; (6) Drug effects. (2) Treatment: (1) Confirm blood pressure values; (2) Exclude surgical factors; (3) Determine the cause of circulatory depression and treat it accordingly; (4) Reduce the degree of sedation and reduce the effects of sedatives. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Injection pain The injection pain of some sedatives is caused by the osmotic pressure and $ mathrm{pH}$ of the preparation irritating the vascular endothelium. Diazepam and etomidate have high osmotic pressures and often cause injection pain. Propofol belongs to the phenolic compound and has a certain irritating effect on vascular tissue, causing pain. end{enumerate} Methods to relieve injection pain include: using a large intravenous injection tube, changing the speed of drug injection, and using local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, etc. intravenously before injection. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Nausea and vomiting Nausea and vomiting are common complications of sedation. end{enumerate} (1) Causes: (1) Patient factors: The incidence rate in women is significantly higher than that in men, in children is higher than that in adults, and in patients over 70 years old is significantly lower than that in younger patients; (2) Drug factors: Morphine can increase the incidence of nausea and vomiting, ketamine and etomidate can induce postoperative vomiting, while propofol and midazolam can reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting; (3) Surgical factors: vomiting is more likely to occur in vestibular, head and neck, upper abdominal surgery, and laparoscopic surgery; (4) Stimulation factors: Postoperative pain, hypotension, hypoxia, and stimulation from gastrointestinal decompression tubes can cause nausea and vomiting. (2) Prevention and treatment: Prevention should be the focus. 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists can effectively prevent and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting; other commonly used antiemetics include droperidol, dexamethasone and metoclopramide. Currently, there is a tendency towards multimodal antiemetics, such as the combination of ondansetron and droperidol, which may be more effective. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Delayed awakening If the patient has not regained consciousness for more than 2 hours after the end of the operation, it is considered delayed awakening. end{enumerate} (1) Causes: (1) Overdose of sedatives: including overdose per unit time, excessive total amount and relative overdose of drugs due to individual differences in patients. Slowed drug metabolism in liver dysfunction, delayed drug excretion in renal dysfunction and poor drug tolerance caused by individual differences can all lead to relative overdose of sedatives. (2) Hypoxemia. (3) Hypotension. (4) Inhalation of low-concentration oxygen: respiratory depression, airway obstruction or chronic hypoxia. When $ mathrm{PaO}_{2}<60 mathrm{mmHg}$ or $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}<75 %$, brain tissue hypoxia may occur, and impaired consciousness may occur. (5) Anemia: If the amount of blood loss during surgery is large and $ mathrm{Hb}<20 sim 50 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{L}$, impaired consciousness may occur. Although the brain of patients with chronic anemia has a strong ability to tolerate hypoxia, delayed postoperative awakening may occur. (6) Sugar metabolism disorders may cause hypoglycemia shock coma, diabetic ketoacidosis coma, and non-ketotic hyperosmolar diabetic coma. (7) Severe water and electrolyte disorders: blood sodium $>160 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ or blood sodium < $100 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, both can cause unconsciousness. (8) Brain diseases: cerebral edema, cerebrovascular accident, etc. (9) Others: uremia, acidosis or alkalosis, increased blood ammonia, hypothermia, and post-cardiac arrest resuscitation. (2) Prevention: (1) Comprehensively understand the pharmacological properties of sedatives, including onset time, duration of action, half-life, and metabolism; (2) Reasonably adjust the sedation withdrawal time: select or terminate the drug according to the patient's condition, operation time, drug action characteristics, and drug interactions; (3) Avoid hypoxemia during sedation; (4) Prevent water and electrolyte disturbances. (3) Treatment: (1) Maintain airway patency and hemodynamic stability, strengthen monitoring, and provide adequate oxygen; (2) Use of antagonists; (3) Correct metabolic disturbances; (4) Treat brain complications. {Chapter 22 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome} Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a clinical syndrome that occurs 24 hours after the onset of severe trauma, infection, sepsis, major surgery, extensive burns, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and pathological obstetrics. It is characterized by dysfunction or failure of two or more organs, either sequentially or simultaneously. In other words, it is a clinical syndrome in which multiple organ functions of acutely injured patients cannot maintain a stable internal environment. The damaged organs and systems include the lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, heart, brain, coagulation and metabolic functions. Direct organ damage or organ dysfunction due to chronic diseases cannot be called MODS. The concept of MODS was formed in the early 1970s. In 1973, Tilney reported a group of cases: 18 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent successful surgery. Although the patients seemed stable at first, they soon suffered from the failure of several organs or systems. Despite full treatment, the lives of most patients could not be saved. The mortality rate of this group of cases was as high as $90%$. In this report, Tilney called this \"sequential system failure\". In 1977, Eiseman named it as a new syndrome, multiple organ failure (MOF), which has been widely used for more than a decade. However, this name mainly describes the end of the clinical process and the irreversibility of the degree, ignoring the characteristics of the dynamic changes in clinical organ function, and has certain limitations. In 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) advocated the use of MODS to replace MOF, referring to the imbalance of the body's internal environment caused by various diseases, including the whole process from early multiple organ dysfunction to multiple organ failure. It is a concept with a broader scope and an earlier understanding of MOF. MODS emphasizes that changes in organ function follow a continuous pathophysiological development process from mild to severe, and its changes are bidirectional, with two possibilities of recovery or deterioration, and emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and early prevention of critically ill patients. At the same time, the clinical manifestations of uncontrolled continuous systemic inflammatory response caused by infection and trauma were named \"systemic inflammatory response syndrome\" (SIRS) at this conference, and SIRS was proposed to be a common feature of excessive inflammatory response of the body caused by infection or non-infectious factors. MODS is the result of progressive aggravation of SIRS, while MOF is the most serious result of the continued development of MODS. The purpose of proposing the concept is to correct the previous overemphasis on the degree of organ failure, and to focus on the whole process of SIRS development, attach importance to early warning and treatment before organ failure, reflecting people's deeper understanding of the syndrome. However, despite great progress in concept understanding and organ function support treatment, the mortality rate of MODS has not been significantly reduced. It is still necessary to fully understand the etiology and pathogenesis of MODS, diagnose and treat it early, and block its development in time to improve the level of clinical treatment. {Section 1 Etiology and Classification} {I. Etiology} MODS is a clinical syndrome induced by multiple factors (see Table 22-1 for common risk factors), but its basic causes are severe trauma and infection, as well as hypovolemic shock, reperfusion injury, excessive inflammation, protein-calorie deficiency, and some iatrogenic factors caused by supportive treatment itself. Severe infection and the sepsis caused by it are the main causes of MODS. About $70%$ of MODS is caused by infection, but clinically, about half of MODS patients cannot find a clear infection focus. Major surgical operations, severe trauma, and shock can also cause MODS in the absence of infection. In the process of MODS, multiple factors may play a role simultaneously or successively. The primary causes of MODS in surgical patients are mainly: (1) severe infection; (2) trauma, burns or major surgery; (3) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation; (4) shock caused by various reasons; (5) severe pancreatitis; (6) certain iatrogenic factors, such as large-volume infusion, blood transfusion, use of antibiotics or corticosteroids, various invasive monitoring and ventilator use, etc. If the patient has chronic organ diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, liver dysfunction, coronary heart disease, or low immune function, such as diabetes, use of immunosuppressants, and malnutrition, MODS is more likely to occur after suffering from the above acute damage. Table 22-1 Major risk factors for MODS begin{center} begin{tabular}{l||l} hline Infection & iatrogenic factors Peritonitis and intra-abdominal infection & delayed or incorrect treatment Pneumonia & blood transfusion Necrotizing soft tissue infection & mechanical ventilation-related lung injury Tropical infections (such as malignant carcinoma, typhoid fever, dengue fever) & treatment-related increase in intra-abdominal pressure Inflammation & poisoning Pancreatitis & drug reactions (such as propofol, amiodarone, monoclonal antibodies) Ischemia & arsenic poisoning Hypovolemic shock & drug poisoning (cocaine, acetaminophen) Mesenteric ischemia & endocrine Immune response & adrenal crisis Autoimmune diseases & pheochromocytoma Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome & thyroid storm Transplant rejection & hydropic edema coma Graft-host disease & hline end{tabular} end{center}\n",
      "{II. Pathogenesis and classification} Infectious or non-infectious pathogenic factors act on the body, stimulating the body to produce a large number of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines (cytokines, $ mathrm{CK}$), complement (complement, $ mathrm{C}$), lectin, bradykinin (bradykinin, $ mathrm{BK}$), platelet activating factor (PAF), nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen free radicals (OFR), etc., causing inflammatory response in the body. If the inflammatory response is maintained at an appropriate level, it is conducive to the elimination of infection and the recovery of the body; if the inflammatory mediators are released excessively or out of control, a waterfall-like chain reaction is formed, resulting in excessive activation of the body's defense mechanism and self-destruction, which is clinically called SIRS. In 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) established the clinical diagnostic criteria for SIRS: SIRS can be diagnosed if two or more of the following four criteria are present: (1) body temperature $>38^{circ} mathrm{C}$ or $<36^{circ} mathrm{C}$; (2) heart rate $>90$ bpm; (3) respiratory rate $>20$ bpm or $ mathrm{PaCO}_{2}<32 mathrm{mmHg}$; (4) white blood cell count $>12 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$ or $<4 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$ or immature granulocytes $>10%$. The incidence of SIRS in critically ill patients is as high as $68% sim 97.6%$. The systemic inflammatory response caused by infection is called sepsis; when combined with one or more organ dysfunction, it is called severe sepsis. In 2001, experts in the field of international sepsis research and treatment further discussed the concept, definition and diagnosis of sepsis and its related terms. In the new sepsis criteria, in addition to the systemic inflammatory response caused by the confirmed or suspected infection, some evidence of organ damage was added, including infection indicators, inflammatory parameters, hemodynamic parameters, organ dysfunction parameters, and tissue perfusion parameters. The concepts of SIRS and MODS have not changed significantly. SIRS can also be caused by non-infectious factors such as trauma, burns, shock, and severe acute pancreatitis, and progressive aggravation can also lead to MODS. Therefore, SIRS is considered to be a common pathway for various factors to cause multiple organ failure. As SIRS is amplified and aggravated by severe trauma, infection, shock and other stimuli, the body begins to produce endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-4, 10, 11, 13 (IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, IL-13), defensins, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) and growth factor (GF), etc. Appropriate anti-inflammatory mediators help prevent or reduce self-tissue damage and internal environment disorders caused by SIRS; excessive release of anti-inflammatory mediators can develop into specific immune system disorders, increase susceptibility to infection, and lead to compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). CARS is the main cause of immune impairment in the early stages of trauma or infection. Its consequences include: (1) Cytokines change from protective to damaging, the inflammatory process goes out of control, local tissues and remote organs are damaged, and MODS including acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are formed. (2) The immune function of the body is severely suppressed, thus causing severe infection, further inducing or aggravating ALI ARDS or MODS. Under normal circumstances, the body's inflammatory response and anti-inflammatory response are balanced to maintain the stability of the internal environment. A variety of pathogenic factors can induce systemic inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. When the body's inflammatory response is dominant, it manifests as SIRS; when the body's anti-inflammatory response is dominant, it manifests as CARS. An imbalance between the body's inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses can ultimately lead to MODS. MODS is divided into two types: primary (single-phase rapid) and secondary (two-phase delayed). Primary MODS refers to the dysfunction of important organs caused directly by the original cause. It occurs in the early stage of primary injury, and the systemic inflammatory response is relatively mild, such as early organ dysfunction in hypovolemic shock, acute respiratory failure caused by direct pulmonary contusion, and renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis. After the original cause acts, the patient's body develops SIRS, and the condition can be relieved and relatively stable after treatment; but if the body is subsequently \"hit\" by infection, blood transfusion, surgery, etc., the reaction process can be expanded or enhanced, and excessive inflammatory response causes multiple organ dysfunctions in remote parts, that is, secondary MODS. In the development of primary MODS, SIRS is not as severe as secondary MODS, and the prognosis is relatively good. Secondary MODS is closely related to the autologous destruction caused by SIRS, often occurs in the late stage of primary injury, is prone to infection, and generally has a poor prognosis. {Section 2 Pathogenesis} The pathogenesis of MODS is very complex, involving neurohumoral, endocrine, immune, and even genetic aspects, which have not been fully elucidated so far. At present, many theories about the pathogenesis of MODS have been proposed. Such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, bacterial toxins, gastrointestinal flora translocation, secondary attack and gene regulation. In general, MODS is not only related to direct injuries such as infection and trauma, but also has an essential connection with the body's own immune inflammatory response to infection and trauma. When the body is hit by serious damaging factors, it will have a defensive response to protect itself. If the reaction is too intense, a large amount of cytokines, inflammatory mediators and other pathological products will be released, damaging cell tissues and leading to MODS. Tissue ischemia-reperfusion process and (or) systemic inflammatory response are its common pathophysiological changes. The uncontrolled inflammatory response caused by the secondary attack is considered to be the most important pathophysiological basis of MODS. {I. Ischemia-reperfusion injury and MODS} Ischemia-reperfusion injury plays an important role in the occurrence and development of many clinical diseases. Severe trauma, such as combined injuries, major surgery, and large-area burns, often causes hypotension and even hypovolemic shock during the course of the disease. Although patients with severe infections may not show obvious signs of blood loss, they often have a hypovolemic process, which can cause low perfusion or perfusion disorders of tissues and organs, tissue ischemia and hypoxia, and cellular energy metabolism disorders. Blood perfusion disorders of affected organs (such as the intestine) can further aggravate systemic inflammatory responses, leading to persistent and irreversible shock states, and finally causing the occurrence of MODS. Restoring tissue microcirculation perfusion can induce the body's stress response, release a large amount of vasoactive substances such as catecholamines and vasopressin, cause vasoconstriction and microcirculatory disorders, reduce tissue oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization disorders, cause ATP utilization to be exhausted, and anaerobic metabolism produces a large number of toxic metabolites. The depletion of ATP causes cell dysfunction and cell membrane $ mathrm{Na}^{+}- mathrm{K}^{+}$ spring dysfunction, which causes sodium and water to be retained in the cell. The accumulation of metabolites causes cell swelling, organelle dysfunction, and eventually cell death. The reperfusion process not only causes greater damage to the ischemic organ, but also to the whole body. During the reperfusion process, a variety of adhesion molecules are produced, causing neutrophils to attach to the vascular endothelium, resulting in endothelial damage and neutrophils to be free outside the blood vessels to cause inflammation, triggering a series of harmful reactions to local and systemic tissues; harmful metabolites reach the whole body through the blood flow, causing damage to various organs in the body, and the first to bear the brunt is the lungs that receive tissue venous blood flow. During the reperfusion period, due to insufficient energy, the excessive $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the cytoplasm cannot be pumped out or absorbed into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in an increase in the intracellular $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. In addition, the $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from outside the cell causes an overload of the intracellular $ mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and a large number of oxygen free radicals are generated. The free radicals react with unsaturated fatty acids to induce lipid peroxidation. The formation of lipid peroxides changes the lipid microenvironment of membrane receptors, membrane proteases, and ion channels, thereby changing their functions; due to the enhancement of lipid peroxidation, the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane are reduced, the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to proteins in the biological membrane is abnormal, the liquid and fluid properties of the membrane are changed, and the permeability is enhanced. The cross-linking of proteins by free radicals will make them lose their activity and change their structure, leading to ischemia-reperfusion injury of organs or tissues, causing serious functional disorders and structural changes.\n",
      "{II. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and MODS} The inflammatory response theory is the cornerstone of the pathogenesis of MODS. In cases of severe infection, trauma, shock or ischemia-reperfusion injury, a large number of inflammatory stimuli (severe hypoxia, endotoxin, C3a, C5a) activate the body's innate immune system, inflammatory cells are activated (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, vascular endothelial cells, platelets), and a large number of inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, PAF, LTB4, TXA, PF34, ADP, P-selectin, L-selectin, etc.), oxygen free radicals, lysosomal enzymes, coagulation substances and overexpressed adhesion molecules (adhesion molecules, AM), etc. These inflammatory mediators further feedback and activate inflammatory cells, causing self-amplification and damage of inflammation, while stimulating the production of a large number of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators and initiating CARS. Inflammatory response is essentially a protective response of the body against external pathogenic factors. Moderate inflammatory response and appropriate humoral mediators play a positive role in the body's resistance to damage and promotion of repair. However, the inflammatory response itself is also destructive to a certain extent. When the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is broken, it will show an unfavorable side to the body. Improper systemic pro-inflammatory response leads to shock, tissue fluid leakage and coagulation disorder, while improper systemic compensatory anti-inflammatory response leads to immune anergy or immunosuppression. Excessive pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses will eventually intensify each other, putting the body in a state of self-destructive immune disorder, leading to MODS. The development process of MODS caused by the imbalance of SIRS and CARS can be divided into three stages: (1) The stage of limited inflammatory response: local injury or infection leads to the release of inflammatory mediators in the local tissue, inducing the local aggregation of inflammatory cells, promoting the elimination of pathogens and tissue repair, and playing a protective role on the body; (2) The stage of limited systemic inflammatory response: a small amount of inflammatory mediators enter the circulation to induce SIRS, inducing the local aggregation of macrophages and platelets. At the same time, due to the increased release of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators, CARS is caused, so that SIRS and CARS are in a state of equilibrium. The inflammatory response is still physiological, and the pro-inflammatory mediator has a slight \"upper hand\". Therefore, it is a \"limited\" systemic inflammatory stage, the purpose of which is to enhance the local defense effect; (3) The stage of imbalance between SIRS and CARS: It manifests in two extremes. One is that a large amount of inflammatory mediators are released into the circulation, stimulating the cascade release of inflammatory mediators, while the endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators are not enough to offset their effects, leading to SIRS; the other extreme is that the excessive release of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators leads to CARS. The consequence of the imbalance between SIRS and CARS is that the inflammatory response goes out of control, turning it from a protective role to a self-destructive role, which not only damages local tissues, but also attacks distant organs, leading to MODS. begin{enumerate} item Localized inflammatory response stage Local injury, reperfusion or infection causes the release of inflammatory mediators in the local tissue, inducing the activation of inflammatory cells in the blood and tissues, chemotaxis and aggregation at the site of damaged tissue, killing bacteria, neutralizing toxins, removing necrotic cells, and promoting tissue repair. At this time, the role of inflammatory mediators is to resist pathogens and remove foreign antigens, and play a protective role for the body. In severe trauma and infection, local inflammatory response is a physiological protective response. At the same time, the body activates the anti-inflammatory system to protect itself. Anti-inflammatory mediators include IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor, transforming growth factor (TGF), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and other unknown factors. Anti-inflammatory cytokines can change the function of macrophages, weaken the ability to present antigens, reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and even directly kill invading microorganisms to protect the body. It can be seen that this stage is of great significance to promote the recovery of the body. If the injury or stimulation is severe or lasting, or suffers a \"second blow\", the course of the disease continues to progress to the stage of limited systemic inflammatory response. item Limited systemic inflammatory response stage If the primary pathogenic factors cause severe damage to the body, inflammatory mediators and anti-inflammatory mediators will appear in the systemic circulation. In patients with severe trauma, a large amount of tissue damage and blood and fluid loss will stimulate the release of inflammatory mediators; in infected patients, pathogens or foreign antigens can directly enter the blood circulation to stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators. During this period, as a normal response of the body to trauma and infection, a large number of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$alpha$, IL-1, IL-6, etc. appear in the circulation, which can promote the expression of adhesion factors on the surface of inflammatory cells and the production of chemokines, causing neutrophils to migrate and aggregate to the site of inflammation. At the same time, inflammatory mediators will stimulate the body to produce compensatory anti-inflammatory responses to inhibit inflammatory responses. SIRS/CARS is in a state of balance, and no severe clinical symptoms and manifestations will occur, nor will MODS occur. When the primary disease persists or new damaging factors exist, the inflammatory cells in a sensitive state will be further activated, leading to the amplification of the inflammatory response. The limited early systemic inflammatory response will develop into an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. item SIRS and CARS imbalance stage When the inflammatory response loses control, severe systemic inflammatory response will ensue. Systemic footnotetext{The inflammatory response is essentially a protective response of the body against disease, but if the inflammation continues to develop or even loses control, the inflammatory response will turn from a protective response to the body to a self-destructive effect. Inflammatory mediators induce mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, etc. to produce a large number of free radicals, release a variety of proteases, induce cell apoptosis, and ultimately lead to multiple organ dysfunction. The mechanism of systemic inflammatory response is not yet fully understood. The main theories are: end{enumerate} (1) The double-strike theory: The first strike of the body puts the inflammatory cells in a sensitized state. If the condition is stable, the inflammatory response can gradually subside. On the contrary, if the body is hit by a second strike, the responsiveness of the inflammatory cells in the sensitized state is abnormally enhanced, causing the sensitized inflammatory cells to break through the self-limiting effect and cause the pro-inflammatory mediators to overflow through uncontrolled self-amplification reactions. (2) Cellular metabolic disorders: Cellular hypermetabolism, energy metabolism disorders and oxygen utilization disorders are the most fundamental causes of MODS and MOF. (3) Gene expression characteristics: The characteristics of patient inheritance and gene expression are the intrinsic reasons for the development of certain diseases and the individual differences in treatment effects. The control genes of inflammatory expression are polymorphic, suggesting that individual genetic characteristics play an important role in systemic inflammatory response. From single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite polymorphisms to DNA polymorphisms, many studies have shown that gene polymorphisms of the interleukin family, defensin family, and other related inflammatory mediators are closely related to the occurrence, development, and outcome of inflammatory responses after infection or trauma. Studies on the role of gene regulation in the occurrence and development of inflammatory responses and MODS have also provided many meaningful findings, among which nuclear factor-$kappa mathrm{B}( mathrm{NF}-kappa mathrm{K}$) has been shown to play a key role in this process. However, other transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) also play an important regulatory role in inflammatory responses. Uncontrolled inflammatory response can lead to the following important pathophysiological changes: (1) Hypotension and oxygen utilization disorder: Under excessive inflammation, endogenous vasodilators prostacyclin $ mathrm{I}_{2} left( right.$ prostacycline, $ left. mathrm{PGI}_{2} right), mathrm{BK}, mathrm{NO}$ increase, leading to low circulatory resistance or even shock in systemic inflammatory response, and tissue oxygen utilization disorder. (2) Myocardial inhibition: Inflammatory mediators such as TNF- $ alpha$, PAF, and leukotrienes (LTs) can inhibit myocardial contraction, reduce coronary blood flow, and cause myocardial cell damage. The ejection fraction and work index of the heart are significantly reduced. Myocardial damage is a high-risk factor that directly leads to heart failure. (3) Continuous high metabolism and malnutrition: The metabolism of the body suffering from severe systemic inflammatory response has the characteristics of autophagy, which is manifested as metabolic disorder. A large amount of protein is consumed in a short period of time, causing the body to fall into severe malnutrition, and the structure and function of tissues, organs and various enzymes are completely damaged. This metabolic disorder is difficult to be corrected by exogenous nutritional support. (4) Endothelial cell inflammatory response and increased vascular permeability, tissue and organ edema, increased oxygen diffusion distance, and aggravated tissue cell hypoxia. (5) Extensive complement activation: C3a and C4a increase, activate white blood cells, increase vascular permeability; C5a decreases, C5a's protective response is inhibited, immune function is damaged, and susceptibility to infection increases. ) Hypercoagulation and microthrombosis: Under the action of severe systemic inflammatory response, the patient's blood system is in a hypercoagulable state, and vascular endothelial inflammation and damage expose the collagen under the intima, which is very likely to lead to the formation of microthrombosis, further aggravating tissue and organ perfusion disorders. Severe patients may develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In the development of SIRS, anti-inflammatory response often dominates, leading to excessive production of anti-inflammatory mediators, and CARS occurs in the body. CARS is mainly immunosuppressive. The release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines caused by stress, or exogenous catecholamines, can further affect the activity of T and B lymphocytes. When trauma patients develop persistent immunosuppression, their bone marrow produces a specific monocyte that can produce high levels of TNF-$ alpha$, IL-1 and IL-6, further activating compensatory proinflammatory responses. Characteristics of CARS: $ mathrm{T}$ cell immunity is low and unresponsive; suppressive $ mathrm{T}$ cells increase; immune presentation defects; macrophage activation is inhibited; $ mathrm{T}$ cell and B cell apoptosis increases. Continuous and uncontrollable inflammatory response causes immune imbalance in the body. Continuous development of SIRS/CARS leads to immune imbalance, resulting in MODS and increasing the risk of death. Cell apoptosis in lymphoid tissue is the direct cause of immune dysfunction after injury. The aforementioned NF-$ mathrm{B}$ can not only mediate the transcriptional expression of a variety of inflammatory mediators, but also participate in the inflammatory response process by regulating the expression of important genes related to apoptosis. After macrophage apoptosis, the loss of its functions such as antigen presentation, cell phagocytosis and mediator synthesis will lead to severe immune dysfunction or CARS. If the apoptosis of macrophages and granulocytes is delayed or not promptly engulfed after apoptosis, it will cause the expansion of inflammation, leading to uncontrolled SIRS and MODS. If the inflammatory response and anti-inflammatory response are restored to balance, patients with immune imbalance may be able to restore organ function. Otherwise, MODS will eventually occur. {III. Intestinal Dynamics Theory} As the digestive organ of the human body, the intestine plays an extremely important role in maintaining normal nutrition of the body. At the same time, the intestine actively participates in various responses after trauma, burns and infection. It is the driving organ for the occurrence of MODS. After injuries such as sepsis, multiple trauma, and shock, the intestine is in a state of low perfusion. In addition, long-term fasting and other reasons lead to weakening or damage of the mucosal barrier function, which is manifested as intestinal mucosal shrinkage, impaired barrier function, increased intestinal mucosal permeability, and a large number of bacteria and endotoxins invade through the mesenteric lymphatic system and portal vein, causing bacterial translocation and enterogenic infection. At the same time, after being over-stimulated by bacteria and endotoxins, the liver Kupffer cells and reticuloendothelial system can also release a large number of inflammatory mediators, cytokines, arachidonic acid, oxygen free radicals, etc., which mediate and activate each other, forming a waterfall effect, leading to MODS. SIRS patients may not have obvious infection foci, but intestinal bacteria are found in their blood cultures. The intestine may be the source of bacteremia in MODS patients. Therefore, the intestine is one of the important sites for inflammatory cell activation and inflammatory mediator release, and is also one of the sources of uncontrolled inflammatory response. From this point of view, the intestinal dynamics theory is actually part of the inflammatory response theory. {Section 3 Clinical diagnosis, disease assessment and monitoring}\n",
      "{I. Clinical diagnosis and staging} Most MODS patients have a history of trauma, infection, major surgery, and clinical manifestations of SIRS; as the disease progresses, the clinical manifestations of related organs also worsen. There is no complete consensus on the diagnostic methods and criteria for MODS. In 1980, Fry proposed the first diagnostic criteria for MOF. The domestic MODS diagnostic criteria were formulated with reference to Fry's MODS diagnostic criteria (Table 22-2). The main diagnostic basis for MODS is: (1) a history of MODS induced by trauma, infection, major surgery, shock, delayed resuscitation, etc.; (2) the presence of clinical manifestations of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome; (3) the presence of two system or organ dysfunction. Early and accurate judgment of SIRS and organ dysfunction is the key to the diagnosis of MODS. In recent years, there has been a deeper understanding of acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure. At the European Society of Critical Care Medicine Annual Meeting held in Berlin in 2011, a new definition of ARDS was proposed, called the ARDS Berlin Definition (Table 22-3). In 2004, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Work Group (AQDI) proposed a new definition, classification system and RIFLE classification criteria, and changed acute renal failure to acute kidney injury (AKI). In 2005, the Acute Kidney Injury Net (AKIN) was formally established, and the RIFLE criteria were revised to the AKIN criteria, which have been recognized as diagnostic criteria (Table 22-4). In 2012, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization launched the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury (KDIGO guidelines), which define AKI as any of the following: an increase in serum creatinine of $geqslant 26.5 mu mathrm{mol} / mathrm{L}$ within 48 hours; or an increase in serum creatinine of 1.5 times the baseline value, known or presumed to have occurred within the previous 7 days; or urine output $<0.5 mathrm{ml} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$, lasting for more than 6 hours.

Generally speaking, the course of MODS can be divided into 4 stages, each with its corresponding clinical characteristics (Table 22-5). The staging of MODS is relative; even at the same stage of development, the degree of dysfunction of each organ is not consistent. For example, in terms of the course of the disease, the respiratory system can quickly reach the level of failure in a short period of time (about 1.8 days $ pm 4.7$ days), while the development of liver failure takes a longer time (about 4.7 days $ pm 5.5$ days).

      "{II. Clinical evaluation of MODS} The clinical evaluation of MODS is difficult, and the scoring method is currently an ideal means to quantitatively and dynamically evaluate the pathophysiological changes of MODS. In 1995, Canadian scholars Marshall and Sibbald et al. proposed a scoring standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of MODS (Table 226). The MODS score obtained by this scoring standard is significantly positively correlated with the mortality rate (Table 22-7), which has a certain guiding role in the prognosis of clinical MODS. In 1996, Vincent et al. proposed the systemic infection-related organ failure scoring standard (SOFA), which not only reflects the pathophysiological process and degree of organ and system failure, but also evaluates the specific MODS related to the disease (infection) (Table 22-8).

In this scoring standard, normal, dysfunctional, and grade $1, 2, and 3$ organs or systems are scored as $0, 1, 2, and 3$ points, respectively. MODS is defined as the sum of the organ grade scores at the same time within 48 hours after admission to the hospital (4 points).

      "{III. Clinical monitoring and examination} The condition of MODS patients is critical and can change significantly in an instant. Modern monitoring technology can not only confirm acute physiological changes, but also guide treatment. For example, monitoring systemic and local tissue perfusion can be used to guide hemodynamic resuscitation of circulatory shock and prevent the progression of MODS. Therefore, MODS patients should be closely observed and monitored. Currently, the commonly used monitoring methods are: begin{enumerate} item Basic monitoring includes body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, etc. item Respiratory monitoring (1) Observation of clinical symptoms: including body position, coordinated movement of respiratory muscles, respiratory rate, chest movement amplitude, cyanosis, etc.; (2) Monitoring of respiratory function and respiratory mechanics: including tidal volume, minute ventilation, airway pressure, maximum inspiratory force, lung compliance, etc.; (3) Bedside chest X-ray examination, which can be reviewed every $24 sim 48$ hours; (4) Arterial blood gas analysis, which can be reviewed regularly or multiple times a day according to the progression of the disease; (5) Other monitoring, such as calculating the alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference, helps to determine the alveolar diffusion function. If necessary, the intrapulmonary shunt $ left(Q_{ mathrm{S}} / Q_{ mathrm{T}} right)$ can also be further calculated. item Hemodynamic monitoring Continuous monitoring of arterial pressure and CVP. Placing a floating catheter can help understand right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and simultaneously measure cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right)$ to understand the imbalance trend between oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$ and oxygen consumption $ left( mathrm{VO}_{2} right)$. Pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring technology can minimally invasively and quickly obtain functional hemodynamic parameters such as stroke volume variation (SVV), cardiac index (CI), peripheral vascular resistance index (SVRI), intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI), and extravascular lung water volume index (EVLWI), which is helpful for clinical evaluation and treatment decision-making of critically ill patients. Bedside cardiac ultrasound technology can non-invasively measure cardiac function parameters. It can be used to quickly and repeatedly check and evaluate the volume status, fluid responsiveness, and cardiac function of critically ill patients, and dynamically guide treatment. item ECG monitoring Arrhythmias are prone to occur in the case of hypoxia, hypotension, or electrolyte imbalance, so it is necessary to continuously monitor the ECG. item Internal environment monitoring Including $ mathrm{pH}$, residual alkali, arterial blood lactate, electrolytes, and plasma osmotic pressure. item Renal function test (1) Urine volume, urine specific gravity, and urine osmotic pressure: not only reflect the status of renal function, but also provide a reference for regulating water and electrolyte balance; (2) Blood potassium and blood and urine creatinine and urea nitrogen determination. item Liver function test In addition to bilirubin, there are also liver enzymes such as sGOT, LDH, sGPT, etc. to reflect the degree of liver parenchymal damage. item Coagulation function test The platelet count of infected patients is reduced, even $<10 times 10^{9} / mathrm{L}$, so clinical attention should be paid. Others include thrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, etc. item Gastrointestinal function monitoring Including observation of abdominal distension, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bowel sound changes, gastric juice color and occult blood test; gastric mucosal $ mathrm{pH}( mathrm{pHi})$ can sensitively reflect the condition of gastrointestinal microcirculation. item Glasgow Coma Scale This table is a simple method for clinically practical monitoring of patient consciousness, with a maximum score of 15 and a minimum score of 3. The higher the score, the better the consciousness state. EEG and brainstem auditory evoked potential monitoring are also used to monitor the patient's central nervous system function. item Serum procalcitonin (PCT) PCT is a sensitive indicator of infection and is positively correlated with the severity of infection. Changes in serum C-reactive protein can reflect the level of stress in the body and can reflect the severity of MODS to a certain extent. end{enumerate} {Section 4 Principles of prevention and treatment of MODS} {I. Prevention of MODS} MODS is not only complex, difficult, and expensive to treat, but also has a high mortality rate. Once it occurs, organ dysfunction will still leave some functional disorders despite active treatment. For example, ARDS patients are prone to respiratory dysfunction, which seriously affects the patient's quality of life. Therefore, MODS focuses on prevention, early detection, and early treatment. It can be said that prevention is the best treatment for MODS. One of the keys to preventing and treating MODS is to identify high-risk patients. The best treatment method should be personalized, but the overall goal is to reduce the risk of progression to MODS, which can be implemented in the following aspects: 11. Optimal supportive treatment for circulatory and respiratory dysfunction; (2) Active prevention and control of infection; 3. Providing early enteral nutrition. In 2004, the publication of the \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock\" globally provided evidence-based medical evidence for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock, and also provided effective treatment methods for MODS, and promoted the improvement of clinical prognosis. {1. Early and adequate resuscitation, focusing on the patient's overall organ function status, especially the regulation of circulatory and respiratory functions} (1) For patients with trauma and shock, resuscitation should be carried out as early as possible, fully and effectively, and efforts should be made to achieve the resuscitation goal within 6 hours. The protection of organ function should be maximized, especially the protection of the original diseased organs, which is the key to preventing MODS. Active fluid resuscitation can significantly reduce the complications of organ damage in patients and significantly increase the survival rate. Rivers proposed that the resuscitation goals for patients with septic shock within the first 6 hours of early resuscitation include: (1) central venous pressure (CVP) $8 sim 12 mathrm{mmHg}$; (2) mean arterial pressure (MAP) $ geqslant$ $65 mathrm{mmHg}$; (3) urine output $ geqslant 0.5 mathrm{ml}( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{h})$; (4) central venous (superior vena cava) blood oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{ScvO}_{2} right) geqslant 70 %$, mixed venous blood oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SvO}_{2} right) geqslant 65 %$. In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, if $ mathrm{CVP}$ reaches the target value within the first 6 hours, but $ mathrm{ScvO}_{2}$ or $ mathrm{SvO}_{2}$ does not reach the target value, concentrated red blood cells ( $ mathrm{RBC}$ ) should be transfused to make the hematocrit (Hct) $ geqslant 30%$ and (or) dobutamine [not exceeding $ 20 mu mathrm{g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{min})$ ] should be given to achieve the treatment goal. (2) Early strengthening of lung management: The first organ of MODS is often the lung. Attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of lung complications, strengthening ventilation management, and implementing lung protective ventilation strategies. The purpose of mechanical ventilation for patients with severe hypoxemia, ARDS, and acute lung injury is to maintain homeostasis, adequately supply oxygen and expel $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$, relieve overloaded respiratory work, and avoid expanding lung damage or affecting the repair of lung tissue. The traditional ALV/ARDS ventilation strategy is to use a larger level of tidal volume $(10 sim 15 mathrm{ml} / mathrm{kg})$ to promote the re-expansion of collapsed alveoli, maintain normal arterial blood gas, and achieve adequate arterial oxygenation with minimal PEEP. Recent studies have shown that traditional ventilation strategies are one-sided and harmful to the body, and can easily lead to excessive expansion of alveoli, causing ventilator-related lung injury (VILI), including barotrauma, volumetrauma, and collapse injury. VILI can further lead to the occurrence of MODS. Lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies include: low tidal volume to make the plateau pressure $<30 mathrm{cmH}_{2} mathrm{O}$, avoid VILI, set PEEP at a moderate level guided by the oxygenation index, maintain $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ at $90%$, and allow hypercapnia. (3) Detect clinical signs of SIRS as early as possible, identify the cause of the disease, take timely treatment measures, and prevent the expansion of inflammatory response. {2. Prevention and control of infection} (1) For patients with trauma and infection, timely and thorough removal of non-blood perfusion and necrotic tissues, adequate drainage, and effective antibiotics should be given to prevent and control the spread of infection. (2) Strictly perform aseptic operations, control invasive operations, and reduce the risk of infection. (3) Selective intestinal decontamination: Use antibiotics that are sensitive to most potential pathogens (mainly facultative or aerobic Gram-negative bacteria), insensitive to obligate anaerobic bacteria, and not easily absorbed orally. Its purpose is to prevent enteric infection by inhibiting Gram-negative aerobic pathogens and fungi in the intestine. {3. Gastrointestinal management and nutritional support} (1) Early enteral nutrition: Early enteral nutrition can protect the intestinal barrier function, reduce the occurrence of bacterial translocation, and provide nutritional support to meet the body's high metabolic needs. (2) When using antibiotics, attention should be paid to the protection of intestinal anaerobic bacteria to avoid destroying the biological barrier constructed by intestinal anaerobic bacteria to inhibit the translocation of intestinal aerobic pathogens. Probiotic preparations are beneficial to restore the balance of intestinal microecology. (3) Prevention and treatment of stress ulcers: Use antacids, proton pump inhibitors or $ mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists. It is not advisable to over-alkalize the stomach. The $ mathrm{pH}$ of gastric juice should be controlled between $4 sim 5$. (4) Adding pharmacological nutrients such as glutamine has an immunomodulatory effect, helps maintain normal cell function, and supports the structure and function of the intestinal mucosal barrier. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Improve the overall condition and maintain the stability of the internal environment. For example, maintain the body's water, electrolyte and acid-base balance and nutritional status in a normal state as much as possible, and eliminate the patient's tension, anxiety or depression. item Strengthen system or organ function monitoring. Its purpose is to detect and treat organ dysfunction in patients at an early stage and guide the treatment of MODS. end{enumerate} {II. Treatment} Since the pathogenesis of SIRS and MODS has not been fully elucidated, the treatment strategy is still mainly supportive treatment.\n",
      "{Chapter 22 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome} Treatment is mainly to correct the physiological disorder caused by organ dysfunction and prevent further damage to organ function. begin{enumerate} item Control the primary disease Treatment for the primary disease is essentially the beginning of MODS treatment. Timely and effective treatment of the primary disease can reduce or block the release of harmful mediators or toxins, and prevent and treat shock and ischemia-reperfusion injury. For example, trauma patients should be actively cleaned and infection should be prevented; patients with severe infection must remove infection foci, necrotic tissue, burn eschar, etc. in various parts of the body, and effective antibiotics should be used; patients with gastrointestinal bloating should have timely gastrointestinal decompression and gastrointestinal function restoration; patients with shock should be quickly and fully resuscitated, and both dominant decompensated shock and latent compensatory shock should be corrected as soon as possible, which is of great significance for maintaining the gastrointestinal membrane barrier function. item Strengthen supportive treatment of dysfunctional organs Support for organ function, especially support for circulatory and respiratory system functions, is the most basic method for treating MODS. Oxygen metabolism disorder is one of the important characteristics of MODS. The most important supportive therapy should be to maintain the stability of circulatory and respiratory functions, improve oxygen utilization disorders, and correct tissue hypoxia. Currently, there are limited means to support tissue oxygen utilization, and the focus of treatment is to increase oxygen supply and reduce oxygen consumption. Oxygen supply $ left( mathrm{DO}_{2} right)$ reflects the overall effect of circulatory and respiratory support, and is mainly related to hemoglobin $( mathrm{Hb})$, oxygen saturation $ left( mathrm{SaO}_{2} right)$ and cardiac output $( mathrm{CO})$. $ mathrm{DO}_{2}=1.38 times mathrm{Hb}^{2} mathrm{SaO}_{2} times mathrm{CO}$. In MODS, it is best to maintain $ mathrm{DO}_{2}>550 mathrm{mV} left( mathrm{min} cdot mathrm{m}^{2} right.$ . Methods to improve oxygen supply include: (1) maintaining $ mathrm{SaO}_{2}>90%$ through oxygen therapy support or mechanical ventilation (high-frequency low tidal volume ventilation, and PEEP when necessary) to increase arterial blood oxygenation; (2) maintaining effective cardiac output (CI> 2. $ left.5 mathrm{~L} left( mathrm{~min} cdot mathrm{m}^{2} right) right)$: appropriately replenishing circulating blood volume and using positive inotropic drugs to support cardiovascular function when necessary; (3) Increasing blood oxygen carrying capacity and maintaining an appropriate hemoglobin concentration are important measures to improve the body's oxygen supply. It is generally believed that the hematocrit should be maintained at around $30%$. Common measures to reduce oxygen consumption: (1) For patients with fever, timely use of physical methods and antipyretic analgesics to reduce temperature; (2) Take effective sedative and analgesic measures for patients with pain and restlessness; (3) For patients with convulsions, convulsions must be controlled in a timely manner; (4) For patients with dyspnea, respiratory support can be used to reduce the work of breathing. item Rational use of antibiotics to prevent and control infections, especially lung infections, nosocomial infections and enteric infections. Antibiotics should be infused as early as possible within the first hour of septic shock and severe sepsis; pathogen culture should be performed before using antibiotics, but the administration of antibiotics should not be delayed; initial empirical antibiotic therapy should include one or more drugs that are effective against all possible pathogens [bacteria and/or fungi] and can achieve sufficient blood drug concentrations at possible infection sites. Antibiotic treatment should be re-evaluated daily to ensure optimal efficacy, while preventing the occurrence of drug resistance, reducing toxicity and reducing treatment costs. Antibiotics should be used in combination for patients with severe sepsis that has or may be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; antibiotics should be used empirically in combination for patients with severe sepsis accompanied by neutropenia. The duration of empirical antibiotic use in patients with severe sepsis should not exceed $3 sim 5$ days. Once the results of the drug sensitivity test are obtained, the treatment should be downgraded as soon as possible to the most effective single drug treatment. The course of antibiotic treatment is generally $3 sim 7$ days. For patients with slow clinical response, undrainable infection foci or immunodeficiency (including neutropenia), the course of treatment may need to be extended. If it is confirmed that the current clinical symptoms are caused by non-infectious factors, antibiotics should be stopped immediately to minimize the possibility of infection with resistant pathogens or drug-related side effects. item Metabolic support and conditioning MODS patients are in a highly stressed state, manifested as metabolic disorders characterized by high metabolism and high decomposition. Nutritional supplementation is required according to the characteristics of high metabolism, and intervention is required in all links leading to high metabolism. The requirements for metabolic support and conditioning are as follows: end{enumerate} (1) Appropriate energy supply: With the deepening of the understanding of metabolic changes after stress, the principle of early energy supply for critically ill patients has changed from the concept of \"higher energy supply\" to \"permissive low calories\" to avoid overfeeding and aggravating the adverse effects on the body's metabolism and organ function. Early supply of $20 sim 25 mathrm{kcal} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$ of energy is the nutritional supply target that most critically ill patients can accept. Pay attention to the ratio of nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen energy, keep the heat: nitrogen ratio at around $100:1$, and increase the ratio of branched-chain amino acids. The energy supply ratio of protein: fat: sugar should generally reach $3:4:3$, use medium and long-chain fatty acids to improve fat utilization, and take in nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract as much as possible. (2) Metabolic conditioning: From the perspective of reducing metabolic rate and promoting protein synthesis, certain drugs are used to intervene in metabolism. Commonly used drugs include cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glutamine and growth hormone. (3) Blood glucose control: It is generally believed that maintaining blood glucose in critically ill patients at $4.4 sim 6.1 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}(80 sim 110 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{L})$ can reduce the mortality of critically ill patients. The 2008 SSC guidelines are relatively loose in terms of blood glucose control targets, and recommend maintaining blood glucose $leqslant 8.3 mathrm{mmol}$ $ mathrm{L}(180 mathrm{mg} / mathrm{L})$. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Hormone therapy Critically ill patients are often described as having \"relative adrenal insufficiency\" (RAI) due to insufficient serum cortisol levels under stress. The pathophysiological mechanism of RAI is still unclear, but existing evidence suggests that it is due to cytokine-mediated reduction in the synthesis and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocortical hormones, and glucocorticoids, leading to adrenal axis suppression. Patients with septic shock, especially those who do not respond well to fluid therapy and vasopressors, should be considered for hydrocortisone therapy (200 mg $/ mathrm{d}, geqslant 7$ ​​days). Patients with severe early ARDS are recommended to use a moderate dose of methylprednisolone $[1 mathrm{mg} /( mathrm{kg}$. d), $ geqslant 14$ days]. item Immunomodulatory therapy Immunomodulatory therapy once gave people great hope for improving the prognosis of sepsis and MODS. Bone proposed the famous compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) hypothesis, pointing out that the occurrence and development of sepsis and MODS are caused by the imbalance of the body's pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. After the two mechanisms are alternately balanced, the anti-inflammatory mechanism often prevails and leads to immunosuppression. Bone's hypothesis laid the foundation for the study of sepsis and immune dysfunction, but the feasibility of clinical immunotherapy for sepsis and MODS is still in the early stages of research. item Blood purification therapy Blood purification technology refers to a general term for various methods of continuously or intermittently removing excess water and solutes from the body. This technology has been gradually developed on the basis of renal replacement therapy technology. Blood purification methods include renal replacement therapy, hemoperfusion, immunoadsorption, endotoxin adsorption and plasma exchange. Currently, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the most widely used. In the late 1970s, CRRT was mainly used to treat patients with severe acute renal failure. With the continuous development of technology, CRRT has been used in the treatment of severe trauma, severe acute pancreatitis, sepsis, poisoning and MODS in the past 30 years. Continuous renal replacement therapy can regulate fluid balance more accurately, maintain hemodynamic stability, have little effect on cardiovascular function, stabilize the body's internal environment, and facilitate active nutrition and supportive treatment; directly remove pathogenic inflammatory mediators and pulmonary interstitial edema, which is conducive to the improvement of ventilation function and the control of pulmonary infection, improve microcirculation and solid cell oxygen uptake capacity, and improve tissue oxygen utilization. item Hypothermia Treatment Mild hypothermia can reduce inflammatory response, reduce endothelial cell damage after ischemia, reduce reactive oxygen generation, and protect tissue antioxidant capacity. Mild hypothermia can produce beneficial effects by inhibiting multiple links of excessive inflammatory response. item Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Using the theories of clearing away heat and detoxification, promoting blood circulation and removing phlegm, and strengthening the body and nourishing yin in traditional Chinese medicine, the use of traditional Chinese medicine formulas such as rhubarb, angelica, and radix phellodendri has a certain clinical effect in the treatment of MODS. For example, the prescription Dachengqi Decoction has the effects of reducing intestinal capillary permeability and reducing inflammatory exudation; protecting the barrier function of the intestinal membrane and preventing the translocation of intestinal bacteria and toxins; promoting intestinal movement, relieving obstruction, and accelerating the excretion of intestinal bacteria and toxins from the body, which can be used to prevent and treat the transformation of SIRS to MODS. Traditional Chinese medicine intervention treatment still requires a lot of experiments and clinical observations. item Holistic Concept The treatment strategy for MODS is not only to provide adequate support and repair for damaged organs, but more importantly to help the body rebuild the already disordered connection network and restore its normal balance. While treating the primary disease or damage, we should also actively regulate the body's neuroendocrine, immune, coagulation, metabolism and other aspects to promote the normalization of the overall internal environment. end{enumerate} {Chapter 23 Nutritional Support for Critically Ill Patients} The main purpose of nutritional support for critically ill patients is to supply the energy and nutritional substrates required for cell metabolism and maintain the structure and function of tissues and organs; regulate metabolic disorders, regulate immune function and enhance the body's disease resistance through the pharmacological effects of nutrients, thereby affecting the development and outcome of the disease. Due to the characteristics of the primary disease and the high metabolic state, critically ill patients are a high-risk group for malnutrition. Their \"autophagic metabolism\" causes a large loss of fat and lean tissue (muscle) and a decrease in immune function, making them prone to complications such as infection. Malnutrition is often ignored or undertreated when the condition is critical, and is significantly associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality. {Section 1 Basic Nutrients} Normal people must take in enough nutrients from food every day to ensure the growth and development of the body, supplement metabolic consumption, enhance disease resistance and prolong life. The ingredients in food that can be digested and absorbed by the human body and have certain physiological functions are called nutrients.\n",
      "{I. Energy and nutrients} A normal diet should include seven nutrients: protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, trace elements and water. Carbohydrates and fats mainly provide heat sources, while proteins mainly provide nitrogen sources. A normal adult needs to consume about $25 sim 35 mathrm{kcal}( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$ of calories under basic conditions; as the intensity of physical activity increases, the amount of calories required also increases accordingly. The body's energy reserves include glycogen, protein and fat. Among them, $1 mathrm{~g}$ of carbohydrates (mainly glucose) can provide $4 mathrm{kcal}$ $(1 mathrm{~kcal}=4.2 mathrm{~kJ})$ of calories, $1 mathrm{~g}$ of fat can provide $9 mathrm{kcal}$ of calories, and $1 mathrm{~g}$ of protein can provide $4 mathrm{kcal}$ of calories. The amount of glycogen stored in the body of an adult is very small, about $300 mathrm{~g}$ in total, and can only store about $1200 mathrm{kcal}$ of calories, which is only enough to consume for 12 hours. Fat is the main source of energy, and the total storage in the body of an adult is about $15 mathrm{~kg}$. There is no storage of protein in the body, and it is a component of various tissues and organs. In certain pathological conditions (starvation or stress), it can be consumed as energy and cause damage to the function of tissues and organs. The percentage of calories provided by carbohydrates, fats and proteins after metabolism is $45% sim 55%, 35% sim 45%$ and 10% 15% of the total calories respectively. begin{enumerate} item Protein (protein) Protein is not used as an energy supply substance. Its functions include: maintaining, repairing and renewing body tissues, synthesizing various biologically active substances (such as enzymes and hormones) and forming antibodies, etc. Providing heat is extremely important for protein synthesis. Only when heat is fully guaranteed can normal protein synthesis occur. The protein requirement of a normal body is $0.8 sim 1.0 mathrm{~g} /$ $( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$, which is equivalent to $0.15 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$ of nitrogen (protein amount $=6.25 times$ nitrogen amount $)$. The protein requirement increases during stress and trauma, and can reach $1.2 sim 1.5 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$. In order to achieve the best nitrogen-saving effect during nutritional support, the ratio of non-protein energy $( mathrm{kcal})/$ nitrogen $( mathrm{g}$) (NPC: $ mathrm{N}$) is recommended to be $130: 1 (100: 1 sim 150: 1)$. end{enumerate} Amino acids are the basic units of protein and can be divided into two categories: essential amino acids (EAA) and non-essential amino acids (NEAA). EAA refers to 8 amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained directly from food. They are leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, lysine, methionine, threonine, valine and tryptophan. Some non-essential amino acids have a very low synthesis rate in the body and need to be supplemented in vitro when the body's demand increases. They are called conditionally essential amino acids, such as arginine, glutamine (glutamine, Gln), histidine and cysteine. Gln has many functions, such as reducing high catabolism, promoting protein synthesis, improving the body's immune function, protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier, and accelerating wound healing. Gln deficiency is easy to occur under stress conditions such as trauma, leading to small intestine and adrenal atrophy, decreased intestinal mucosal barrier function and bacterial translocation. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Carbohydrates Glucose is the main energy substance that can be directly used by the body. In addition to providing calories and saving protein, it is an important component of cytoplasm and nucleus to form RNA and DNA with phosphate and bases. The glycoprotein formed by the combination of carbohydrates and proteins is a component of cartilage, bone and cornea. The large-scale synthesis of glycogen can enhance the regeneration of liver cells and promote the metabolism and detoxification of the liver. After digestion, polysaccharides and disaccharides are finally absorbed in the form of monosaccharides. All monosaccharides are converted into glucose in the liver, which is mainly used to provide energy and synthesize glycogen to be stored in the liver and muscles. Some monosaccharides, polysaccharides and their derivatives cannot be directly decomposed and absorbed by human digestive enzymes. These sugars are also called dietary fiber. Dietary fiber can produce short-chain fatty acids through bacterial fermentation in the colon. Dietary fiber can promote the colon's reabsorption of water and electrolytes; maintain normal intestinal function, prevent diarrhea and constipation; and increase stool weight and improve stool quality. Healthy adults should consume 30g of fiber every day. Dietary fiber is a beneficial additive when preparing enteral nutrition. item Fat Most of the fat in food is in the form of triglycerides. After fat is digested and absorbed, part of it is consumed to provide calories, and the other part is stored in the form of fat under the skin, abdominal cavity, muscle space and around the kidneys, etc. It not only plays a role in forming body tissues, but also maintains body temperature and protects organs; a small amount is stored in liver cells in the form of phospholipids. The daily fat supply should not be too much. The total amount of fat for normal adults should not exceed $40 sim 50 mathrm{~g}$. The essential fatty acids should not be less than $3%$ of the total energy. The ideal linoleic acid: linolenic acid ratio is about $5:1$. In addition to supplying 30%-35% of the total daily calories, the phospholipids and cholesterol in the fat intake are components of nerve tissue and can also promote the absorption and utilization of some fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Item Vitamins Vitamins (vitamine, $ mathrm{Vit}$) are organic substances necessary for normal human metabolism, and most of them cannot be synthesized by the body. Vitamins can be divided into fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. The former include vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin $K$, and the latter include vitamin $ mathrm{C}$, vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{1}$, vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{2}$, vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{6}$, vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{12}$, vitamin $ mathrm{H}$, niacin, folic acid and pantothenic acid. Very small amounts of vitamins can meet the needs of the human body, and their main sources are fresh vegetables and fruits. Patients who fast for a long time need to supplement a certain amount of vitamins intravenously. item Minerals and trace elements Minerals and trace elements mainly include sodium, chlorine, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, as well as trace elements such as iodine, chromium, molybdenum, copper, manganese, fluorine, cobalt, zinc, and selenium. Its functions include: participating in the regulation of acid-base balance; maintaining osmotic pressure; participating in the transport of substances through cell membranes; participating in the conduction of nerve impulses and the excitation and contraction of muscle fibers; constituting components of the body such as bones and teeth. item Water Water is an important substance necessary for the human body, accounting for about $60%$ of body weight. The daily water requirement of a normal adult is about $2500 mathrm{ml}$. Only with sufficient water supply can the body normally absorb energy and perform normal physiological functions. end{enumerate} {II. Determination of nutritional status} Malnourished patients are divided into three types. The first type is adult marasmus, the main reason for which is insufficient calorie intake, which is usually unrelated to systemic inflammatory response. It is common in patients with chronic diseases or long-term hunger, such as anorexia nervosa, obstruction caused by esophageal stenosis, or patients with severe malabsorption syndrome. The main clinical manifestations are severe fat and muscle consumption. The second type is called hypoproteinemia or acute visceral protein consumption malnutrition. The main reason is insufficient protein intake. It is common in severe systemic inflammatory reactions caused by severe trauma, infection, and large-area burns. It may also be accompanied by a significant reduction in food intake. This type of malnutrition is accompanied by obvious abnormalities in biochemical indicators, mainly a significant decrease in plasma albumin and lymphocyte count. The patient's fat reserves and muscle mass can be within the normal range, so some anthropometric indicators can still be normal, but the quality of visceral protein decreases rapidly, hair is easy to fall off, edema and wound healing are delayed. If this type of malnutrition is not effectively supported by nutrition, the patient may suffer from severe bacterial and (or) fungal infections due to decreased immune function. The third and most serious type is called mixed malnutrition. This type of patient has insufficient protein and calories intake, which is common in the terminal stage of the disease. This type of patient originally has little energy reserves. Under stress, the body's protein is rapidly consumed, and complications such as infection and wound healing are very likely to occur. The condition is critical and the mortality rate is high. {(I) Assessment of nutritional status of critically ill patients} It is difficult to assess the nutritional status of critically ill patients. Currently, the commonly used methods are: {1. Body measurement parameters (such as skin wrinkle thickness and mid-upper arm circumference) are often used to assess the nutritional status of specific populations rather than individuals} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Biochemical test indicators These indicators have their limitations. Albumin levels drop rapidly during the acute reaction period; hemoglobin is affected by bleeding and bone marrow suppression; prealbumin, transferrin and lymphocyte counts may be helpful, but are affected by the patient's hydration status. item Body mass index $ left[ right.$ Weight $( mathrm{kg}) /$ Height $ left.( mathrm{m})^{2}, mathrm{BMI} right]$ is also used to assess nutritional status (if $ mathrm{BMI}<18.5$, it is considered to be underweight), and it is an independent predictor of mortality in critically ill patients. However, BMI cannot reflect changes in acute nutritional status in critically ill patients. item Individual systemic assessment This is a generally accepted method of measuring nutritional status that focuses on history and physical examination. The correct process for taking a history includes: end{enumerate} (1) Weight change (weight change $>5%$ within 3 weeks or $>10%$ within 3 months). (2) Changes in food intake. (3) Gastrointestinal symptoms. (4) Functional insufficiency. This history is combined with the following physical examination evidence: (1) Loss of subcutaneous fat: especially in the chest and triceps (BMI $<20). $ (2) Muscle wasting: especially in the cheeks, triceps and buttocks. (3) Edema. (4) Ascites. Although it is an individual indicator, it is reproducible and has been associated with mortality in many situations. {(ii) Estimating nutritional requirements} Macronutrients (such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates) should be balanced to meet the body's energy needs; while micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals) do not provide energy and are mainly used to maintain health. Nutritional requirement estimation is usually divided into the following four steps: begin{enumerate} item Calculate the number of calories needed for resting energy expenditure Energy estimation requires complex equipment, so it is usually calculated according to the formula. Harris-Benedict formula can be used to estimate the basal metabolic rate (BMR) required for daily calories: end{enumerate} Male BMR $( mathrm{kcal} / mathrm{d}): 66+(13.7 times mathrm{W})+(5 times mathrm{H})-(6.8 times mathrm{A})$ Female BMR (kcal/d) : $655+(9.6 times mathrm{W})+(1.8 times mathrm{H})-(4.7 times mathrm{A})$ Where: $ mathrm{W}=$ Weight $( mathrm{kg}), mathrm{H}=$ Height $( mathrm{cm}), mathrm{A}=$ Age (years) Based on the results of this formula, the daily calorie requirement is approximately $25 mathrm{kcal} / mathrm{kg}$. This formula estimates healthy individuals without fever, so it needs to be adjusted according to stress level. The stressors that need to be adjusted are as follows: surgery $=1.2$; starvation $=0.85 sim 1$; trauma $=1.35$; sepsis $=1.6$; severe burns $=2.1$ If the patient's temperature is above $37^{ circ} mathrm{C}$, the BMR is increased by $10 %$ for every $1^{ circ} mathrm{C}$ increase (up to $40^{ }^{ circ} mathrm{C}$). Daily maintenance energy requirement $=BMR times$ stress factor $ times 1.25$ (the additional $25 %$ is used for activities within the hospital; if the patient is in a paralyzed state or deeply sedated state supported by a ventilator, the additional $25 %$ energy requirement is not added).\n",
      "{2. Calculate protein requirements} (1) Under normal circumstances: protein requirement is $0.8 sim 1 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d}$ ) (maximum $60 sim 70 mathrm{~g} / mathrm{kg}$ ). (2) Consumption/stress state: mildly increased to $1 sim 1.5 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$, severe cases increased to $1.5 sim 2 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$ . (3) Pre-dialysis patients with renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy have reduced protein requirements. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Calculate non-protein (carbohydrate + fat) components end{enumerate} (1) Using fat to provide calories can reduce the risk of excess glucose and reduce the total amount of fluid. (2) Because fat may reduce the body's immune response, the amount of fat should be less than $40%$ of the total calories. (3) At least $4%$ of the total calories are provided by essential fatty acids (linoleic acid). (4) The remaining calories are provided by carbohydrates (glucose). The caloric content of the main nutrients ($ mathrm{kcal} / mathrm{g}$) is: fat: 9; protein: 4; carbohydrates: 4; intravenous sugar: $3.4; 1 mathrm{ml} 10%$ fat emulsion: 1.1. {4. Calculation of micronutrients (vitamins, electrolytes and trace elements)} (1) Daily vitamin requirements: Vitamin A 3300IU, Vitamin D $200 mathrm{IU}$, Vitamin E 10IU, Vitamin B1 3mg, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{2} 3.6 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{3} 40 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{5} 15 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{6} 4 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{7} 60 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{9}$ $0.4 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{12} 5 mathrm{mg}$, Vitamin C $100 mathrm{mg}$; Vitamin K $2 sim 4 mg/week. Patients with sepsis lose a large amount of vitamin A and need to replenish it in large quantities. (2) Daily electrolyte requirements: Na^+: 1.0 sim 2.0; K^+: 0.7 sim 1.0; Ca^2+: 0.1; Mg^2+: 0.1; Cl^-: 1.0 sim 2.0; PO4^-: 0.4. If the body's potassium, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus and sulfur are low, catabolism and loss of lean body tissue may occur. (3) Daily trace element requirements $( mathrm{mg} / mathrm{d}):$ Chromium: $10 sim 15$; Copper: $500 sim 1500$; Manganese: $150 sim 800$; Selenium: $30 sim$ Table 23-1 Calculation of nutritional requirements based on BMI begin{center} begin{tabular}{cc} hline BMI & Energy $[ mathrm{kcal} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})]$ hline $<15$ & $35 sim 40$ $15 sim 19$ & $30 sim 35$ $20 sim 25$ & $20 sim 25$ $26 sim 29$ & $15 sim 17$ $>29$ & $15^{ circ}$ hline end{tabular} end{center} *Obese patients should not exceed $2000 mathrm{kcal}$, to mobilize reserve fat 60; zinc: 2500 4000. Severe burn patients lose a lot of copper, zinc and selenium through exudate, and severe trauma patients lose a lot of zinc and selenium through drainage fluid, so attention should be paid to supplement accordingly. Some other units use body mass index (BMI) to estimate nutritional needs (Table 23-1). {Section 2 Choice of nutritional support} Malnutrition, severe trauma, severe infection or severe complications after surgery are all indications for nutritional support. Gastrointestinal nutrition is the first choice for nutritional support; only those who cannot or are unwilling to take it orally or whose gastrointestinal tract needs to rest should choose parenteral nutrition. When providing nutritional support, attention should be paid to the comprehensive supply of nutrients, and the nutritional plan should be adjusted according to the needs of the disease and the patient's tolerance under dynamic monitoring. At the same time, the nutritional status of the patient must be evaluated regularly, ultimately achieving the goal of both meeting the patient's metabolic needs and reducing the occurrence of complications. The specific implementation process of nutritional support has great individual differences, that is, it varies according to the patient's basic conditions, disease types, begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-242} end{center} Figure 23-1 Selection of nutritional support programs for critically ill patients and treatment effects. However, for critically ill patients, as long as the main principles are mastered, postoperative complications and mortality rates can be reduced, hospital stays can be shortened, hospitalization costs can be reduced, and the quality of life of critically ill patients can be improved. This is called a reasonable nutritional support program (Figure 23-1). {Section 3 Enteral Nutrition} \"As long as the gastrointestinal tract is functional, use it\" has become a consensus among clinical physicians. Enteral nutrition (EN) Application indications: Enteral nutrition should be given priority to critically ill patients who have gastrointestinal function (or partial function) but cannot take food orally. Enteral nutrition is significantly superior to parenteral nutrition in terms of support effect, cost, safety, and feasibility. When critically ill patients have intestinal obstruction and intestinal ischemia, enteral nutrition often causes excessive expansion of the intestine, aggravates the deterioration of intestinal blood flow, and even intestinal necrosis and intestinal perforation; in severe abdominal distension or abdominal compartment syndrome, enteral nutrition increases intra-abdominal pressure, and intra-abdominal high pressure will increase the risk of reflux and aspiration pneumonia, and further deteriorate respiratory and circulatory functions. Therefore, enteral nutrition should be avoided in these cases. For patients who develop severe abdominal distension and diarrhea after enteral nutrition and do not improve after general treatment, it is recommended to temporarily stop enteral nutrition. Compared with delayed enteral nutrition, early enteral nutrition can significantly reduce mortality and infection rates, improve nutritional intake, and reduce hospitalization costs. Other studies have shown that early enteral nutrition can be feasible through optimized enteral nutrition management measures (such as jejunal nutrition, gastrointestinal prokinetic drugs, etc.). Therefore, if conditions permit, critically ill patients should use enteral nutrition as early as possible. Early enteral nutrition usually refers to \"within 24-48 hours of admission to the ICU\", and is started when the hemodynamics are stable and there are no contraindications to enteral nutrition. {(I) Routes of enteral nutrition} The routes of enteral nutrition can be nasogastric tube, nasojejunal, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ), intraoperative gastrostomy/jejunostomy, or enteric fistula, etc. according to the patient's condition. begin{enumerate} item Nasogastric tube route It is often used for patients with normal gastrointestinal function, non-comatose patients, and patients who can transition to oral diet after a short period of tube feeding. The advantages are simplicity and ease of use. The disadvantages are increased incidence of reflux, aspiration, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. item Transnasal jejunal feeding The advantage is that the tube enters the duodenum or jejunum through the pylorus, which reduces the incidence of reflux and aspiration, and increases the patient's tolerance to enteral nutrition. However, at the beginning of feeding, the osmotic pressure of the nutrient solution should not be too high. item Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) PEG refers to percutaneous gastrostomy under the guidance of a fiber gastroscope, and the feeding tube is placed in the stomach cavity. The advantage is that the nasal tube is removed, the infection complications of the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract are reduced, and the feeding tube can be left in place for a long time. It is suitable for critically ill patients who cannot eat for a long time, such as coma and esophageal obstruction, but have good gastric emptying. item Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) PEJ is a percutaneous gastrostomy under the guidance of an endoscope, and the feeding tube is placed in the upper jejunum under the guidance of an endoscope. The gastric cavity can be decompressed while jejunal nutrition is given, and it can be left in place for a long time. Its advantages include reducing the risk of reflux and aspiration, and gastroduodenal decompression during feeding. It is especially suitable for critically ill patients with aspiration risk, gastric motility disorder, duodenal stasis, etc. who need gastroduodenal decompression. end{enumerate} {(II) Enteral nutrition preparations} To meet the needs of body metabolism, the ingredients of EN preparations are very complete, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats or their decomposition products, and also contain physiologically required electrolytes, vitamins and trace elements. The preparations are divided into powder and solution. The former needs to be used after adding water. In addition, there are high-energy formulas and high-nitrogen formulas to choose from. The former provides higher energy with less volume and is suitable for patients who need to limit the amount of fluid; the latter has a nitrogen-to-calorie ratio of about $1 mathrm{~g}: 313 mathrm{~kJ}$ ( $75 mathrm{kcal})$, which is suitable for patients who need to supplement a large amount of protein. EN preparations can be roughly divided into two categories: begin{enumerate} item Preparations based on whole protein The protein source is casein or soy protein, the carbohydrate source is maltose and dextrin, and the fat source is corn oil or soybean oil; it does not contain lactose; the osmotic pressure of the solution is low (about $320 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$). It is suitable for people with normal gastrointestinal function. item Preparations based on protein hydrolysate (or amino acid) Also known as elemental diet, its protein source is whey protein hydrolysate, peptides or crystalline amino acids, the carbohydrate source is oligosaccharides and dextrin, and the fat source is soybean oil and medium-chain triglycerides; it does not contain lactose; the osmotic pressure is high ( $470 sim 850 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L})$. It is suitable for people with poor gastrointestinal digestion and absorption function. However, since the high osmotic pressure of this type of formula tends to attract free water into the intestinal cavity and is prone to diarrhea, it requires enhanced care during use. end{enumerate} Some preparations also contain glutamine, dietary fiber, etc. New products also include preparations suitable for severe stress, diabetes, cancer, and preparations that enhance immunity. There are also special disease formulas available, such as liver disease: low sodium and reduced protein content to reduce the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy; kidney disease: low phosphorus, low potassium and high calories $(2 mathrm{kcal} / mathrm{ml})$ to reduce the amount of liquid; respiratory disease: high fat content to reduce the production of $ mathrm{CO}_{2}$. {(III) Management of enteral nutrition and safety assessment of enteral feeding} Severely ill patients often have gastrointestinal motility disorders. The head-up position can reduce the possibility of reflux and aspiration and related lung infections. The gastric residual volume should be closely checked for patients receiving gastric nutrition to avoid the risk of aspiration. It is usually necessary to aspirate the gastric residual volume every 6 hours. If the retained volume is less than 200 ml, the original rate can be maintained; if the retained volume is less than 100 ml, the infusion rate can be increased to 20 ml/h; if the residual volume is less than 200 ml, the infusion rate should be temporarily stopped or reduced. During enteral nutrition infusion, the following measures can help increase the body's tolerance to enteral nutrition: for patients with enteral nutrition intolerance (gastric retention $>200 mathrm{ml}$, vomiting), gastrointestinal motility drugs can be used; the concentration of the nutrient solution should be from dilute to concentrated at the beginning of enteral nutrition; use a motility controller to control the speed, and gradually increase the infusion rate; clamp a warmer at the end of the feeding tube to help patients tolerate enteral nutrition.\n",
      "{(IV) Complications of enteral nutrition} Enteral nutrition is safer and easier to perform than parenteral nutrition support, but it can also cause a series of related complications due to factors such as unreasonable selection or preparation of nutrients, contamination of nutrient solution and improper care. begin{enumerate} item Mechanical complications Mainly related to the placement, softness and location of the feeding tube and care, including damage to the nasopharyngeal and esophageal mucosa, feeding tube obstruction, etc. item Infectious complications Reflux aspiration can lead to aspiration pneumonia, which is more common in patients fed through nasogastric tubes. Causes include: (1) slow gastric emptying; (2) nausea and vomiting causing feeding tube displacement; (3) poor body position and reflux of nutrient solution; (4) impaired cough and vomiting reflexes; (5) mental disorders; (6) use of sedatives and neuromuscular blockers. Preventive measures include: elevating the patient's head by $30^{ circ} sim 40^{ circ}$; aspirating and estimating the gastric residual volume before each infusion, if it is greater than $200 mathrm{ml}$, the infusion should be suspended, and gastrokinetic drugs should be added if necessary; placing the feeding tube below the pylorus or infusing through the jejunum. item Gastrointestinal complications The most common gastrointestinal complications of enteral nutrition are nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, intestinal cramps, constipation and diarrhea. Among them, diarrhea is the most common, accounting for about $5% sim 30%$ of enteral nutrition patients. These gastrointestinal complications may be related to factors such as the type of enteral nutrition agent, the high osmotic pressure of the nutrient solution, the excessively fast infusion speed and low temperature of the nutrient solution, and the contamination of the nutrient solution. Preventive and control measures include: (1) adding intestinal probiotic preparations; (2) selecting nutritional preparations suitable for individuals; (3) adjusting osmotic pressure and gradually increasing the concentration and dosage of nutrient solution; (4) controlling the drip rate, preferably using an infusion source to control; (5) adjusting the temperature of the nutrient solution; (6) using antidiarrheal drugs when necessary. item Metabolic complications The gastrointestinal tract has a buffering effect, so metabolic complications are less likely to occur during enteral nutrition. Close monitoring and timely adjustment of enteral nutrition regimens or infusion methods can prevent hyperglycemia or water and electrolyte metabolism disorders. end{enumerate} {Section 4 Parenteral Nutrition} Indications for parenteral nutrition (PN) include: (1) critically ill patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction; (2) critically ill patients who are prohibited from using the gastrointestinal tract due to surgery or anatomical factors; (3) the presence of uncontrolled abdominal conditions, such as abdominal infection, intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula, etc. Parenteral nutrition support should not be given in the following situations: (1) Early resuscitation stage, hemodynamics not yet stable or severe water, electrolyte and acid-base imbalance; (2) Severe liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy; (3) Acute renal failure with severe azotemia; (4) Severe hyperglycemia has not been effectively controlled. {(I) Route of parenteral nutrition} Parenteral nutrition support can be provided through central venous or peripheral venous nutrition support. If a complete and adequate nutritional supply is provided, ICU patients mostly choose the central venous route. For patients with a small volume of nutrient solution, low concentration and partial parenteral nutrition support, the peripheral venous route can be adopted. The central venous route includes the subclavian vein, internal jugular vein, femoral vein and peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) route. The subclavian vein infection and thrombotic complications are lower than those of the femoral vein and internal jugular vein routes. PICC cannot reduce the incidence of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). For ICU patients whose whole body organ function status tends to be stable, but who are difficult to get rid of or completely get rid of parenteral nutrition due to illness, this route can be chosen to provide PN support. {(II) Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)} TPN refers to a method of providing appropriate amounts of protein (AA), fat, carbohydrates, electrolytes, vitamins and trace elements completely through intravenous routes to achieve nutritional support. The purpose is to maintain the normal physiological function of the body, promote patient recovery, and improve nutritional status. Nutritional support for critically ill patients during the acute stress period should follow the \"allowable low calorie\" principle $[20 sim 25 mathrm{kcal} / mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})]$; after the stress and metabolic state are stabilized, the energy supply needs to be appropriately increased $[30 sim 35 mathrm{kcal} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})]$. {1. General principles of total parenteral nutrition} (1) Glucose is the main source of carbohydrates in parenteral nutrition, generally accounting for $50% sim 60%$ of non-protein calories, and should be adjusted according to the state of glucose metabolism. (2) The amount of fat supplement is generally $40% sim 50%$ of non-protein calories; the intake can reach $1 sim 1.5 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$, which should be adjusted according to the lipid-clearing capacity. Fat emulsions should be infused slowly and evenly. (3) The amount of protein supplied during parenteral nutrition is generally $1.2 sim 1.5 mathrm{~g} /( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$, which is approximately equivalent to $0.20 sim 0.25 mathrm{~g} /$ $( mathrm{kg} cdot mathrm{d})$ of nitrogen; the heat-nitrogen ratio is $100 sim 150 mathrm{kcal}: 1 mathrm{~g} mathrm{~N}$. (4) The volume of nutrient solution should be determined based on the condition and specific needs of each patient, taking into account daily fluid balance and preload status, and adjusted as needed. (5) Amino acids and glucose should be infused at the same time to ensure that the amino acids can be fully utilized by the body to avoid being consumed as calories. (6) During the long period of parenteral nutrition support without fat emulsion, fat emulsion should be supplemented regularly to prevent the occurrence of essential fatty acid deficiency. (7) Vitamins and trace elements should be included as components of nutritional support for critically ill patients. Patients with trauma, infection, and ARDS should be appropriately supplemented with antioxidant vitamins and selenium. It is best to mix a day's worth of nutrient solution in a three-liter bag and drip it at a uniform rate over 24 hours. The use of a three-liter bag can simplify the infusion steps, reduce the number of infusion tubes, and reduce the amount of nursing care; using a specific infusion bag to fully seal the preparation under a sterile environment can reduce the chance of contamination and avoid gas detection; various nutrients dilute each other, reduce concentration, reduce osmotic pressure, reduce complications associated with high-concentration glucose infusion, and reduce insulin dosage; various nutrients are evenly infused, with higher utilization and more scientific efficiency; it can improve nitrogen balance and achieve positive nitrogen balance faster than single-bottle infusion. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Complications of total parenteral nutrition Complications may occur during the use of total parenteral nutrition. Some complications are quite serious and should be discovered and treated in a timely manner. end{enumerate} (1) Refeeding syndrome: Regardless of the nutritional support route, patients with severe malnutrition or starvation may develop refeeding syndrome within a few days of the initial nutritional support. Its mechanism of occurrence is: starvation leads to loss of intracellular electrolytes; transmembrane pump function declines and leaks, resulting in severe depletion of intracellular storage. When carbohydrates are given again, electrolytes flow into the cells in an insulin-dependent manner, resulting in a rapid decrease in plasma phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and calcium levels. Clinical symptoms include weakness, respiratory failure, heart failure, arrhythmia, seizures, and even death. Therefore, feeding must be started slowly, with $25%$ to $50% of the required calories given at the beginning, and then slowly increased after 4$ days. At the same time, the required electrolytes should be supplemented. Vitamin $ mathrm{B}_{1}$ and other B vitamins should be given intravenously before starting feeding, and should be given for at least 3 consecutive days. (2) Overfeeding: Deliberate overfeeding to reverse the catabolic state is often accompanied by adverse consequences, which can lead to uremia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver (cirrhosis), hypercapnia (especially when too much carbohydrate is given), and excessive volume. Parenteral nutrition is often associated with overfeeding, and sometimes even some mild underfeeding (about $85%$ of required energy) may occur. (3) Hyperglycemia: Hyperglycemia can be associated with overfeeding, but it is usually not caused by it. Critically ill patients may also develop hyperglycemia due to undiagnosed diabetes or insulin resistance caused by stress. In 2001, Ven den Berghe et al. reported that strict blood sugar control (target blood sugar 4.4 6. $1 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$) in critically ill patients after surgery can significantly reduce ICU mortality (from $8.0%$ to $4.6%$) compared with conventional treatment (giving insulin only when blood sugar $>11.9 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$, and maintaining blood sugar at $10 sim 11.1 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$), while also reducing ICU stay time, ventilator support time, sepsis, and dialysis and blood transfusion volume. Strict blood sugar control is beneficial for patients who stay in the ICU for more than 5 days. Recent studies have questioned the safety of strict blood sugar control. In 2009, a large randomized controlled trial randomly divided patients into strict blood sugar control at $4.5 sim 6.0 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ or conventional blood sugar control target blood sugar below $10.0 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. The results showed that $6.8%$ of patients in the strict blood sugar control group experienced severe hypoglycemia, while $0.5% in the conventional control group (P<0.001)$; there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of ICU stay, hospital stay, ventilator support or renal replacement therapy time. The study suggested that strict blood sugar control in adult ICU patients can increase mortality: target blood sugar control at $leqslant 10.0 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$ can reduce patient mortality more than target blood sugar control at $4.5 sim 6 mathrm{mmol} / mathrm{L}$. (4) Electrolyte imbalance and micronutrient deficiency: Electrolyte imbalance and micronutrient deficiency are particularly prone to occur in patients who require long-term nutritional support. They should be closely monitored and prevented. (5) Central venous catheter-related complications: Parenteral nutrition for critically ill patients is usually given through the central vein. Central venous catheter placement itself has certain risks (see Chapter 15). (6) Sepsis: Overfeeding, uncontrollable hyperglycemia and infection caused by parenteral nutrition can increase the risk of sepsis. Nutrition bags must be sterile and must be discarded within 24 hours of initial use. When replacing nutrition bags, attention must be paid to aseptic operation, and the central venous line cannot be used for blood collection or administration of other drugs or nightshades. In addition, parenteral nutrition can induce hepatobiliary diseases such as fatty liver, cirrhosis and acalculous cholecystitis. {Section 5 Pharmaco/immunonutrition} Pharmaco/immunonutrition is a relatively new concept in critical care nutritional support, and more and more evidence shows its advantages. Despite adequate nutritional support, nosocomial infections in critically ill patients remain a serious problem. To reduce patients' susceptibility to infection, it is recommended to add specific nutrients to the regular diet to enhance the body's immune response. The so-called \"immunonutrition\" usually targets the gastrointestinal tract (such as intestinal cells or immune cells in the small intestine) to prevent or reduce bacterial translocation or bacterial production. In critically ill patients, the total amount of calories used for rapid new metabolic cells may become the rate-limiting factor for some normal immune responses. The function of circulating immune cells (mainly lymphocytes and macrophages) may also be affected by the composition of the diet. Studies have shown that immunonutrition can improve the function of immune cells. The administration of enteral nutrition formulas containing immunonutrition ingredients can reduce the infection rate and shorten the length of hospital stay in some ICU patients. However, there is still controversy and further research is needed. Some ICUs have established guidelines for immunonutrition support. Immunonutrition support is started when the patient has been in the ICU for more than 24 hours. Immunonutrition mainly includes arginine, $ Omega 3, Omega 6$ fatty acids and nucleotides, and glutamine. The functions of its components are as follows: begin{enumerate} item Arginine can improve the body's immune response to bacteria, viruses and tumor cells, promote wound healing and increase protein turnover. item $ Omega 3$ fatty acids can enhance immune function and reduce infection by enhancing neutrophil activity. item Nucleotides are essential components for maintaining cell integrity and promoting the growth of repair cells. item Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body and plays an important role in severe stress. It can improve anabolism and may be an important intestinal growth factor. end{enumerate} {Chapter 24 Pain Diagnosis and Treatment}\n",
      "{Section 1 Overview} Pain is an unpleasant feeling and emotional experience that is associated with tissue damage or potential damage, or can be described by tissue damage (International Association for the Study of Pain, 1994). Pain contains two components: sensory and emotional. The sensory component has the common characteristics of other senses, including special receptors, appropriate stimulation required for receptor activation, localization and distribution of receptors, and discrimination of stimulus intensity; the emotional component of pain is closely related to the drive to escape, has great variability, and is easily affected by past experience. {(I) Clinical classification of pain} Pain can be classified according to the degree of pain, the onset of pain, and the location of pain. begin{enumerate} item Classification by pain degree can be divided into mild pain, moderate pain, and severe pain. item Classification by onset of pain can be divided into acute pain and chronic pain. item Classification by location of pain can be divided into: (1) Superficial pain: located on the body surface or mucous membrane, mostly sharp pain, with clear location; (2) Deep pain: located in the internal organs, joints, etc., generally dull pain, not limited, and with unclear location. end{enumerate} {(II) Effects of pain on physiology} begin{enumerate} item Mental and emotional changes Acute pain causes patients to become excited, anxious, and even cry and feel uneasy. Long-term chronic pain can cause depression and apathy. item Endocrine system. Pain can cause stress responses, prompting the body to release a variety of hormones, such as catecholamines, cortisol, angiotensin II, antidiuretic hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, omegaly, growth hormone, and thyroxine. item Circulatory system Severe pain can excite the sympathetic nerves, increase the levels of catecholamines and angiotensin II in the blood, and lead to increased blood pressure, tachycardia, and arrhythmia. The increase in aldosterone, glucocorticoids, and antidiuretic hormone can cause water and sodium retention in the patient's body, further increasing the heart's load. item Respiratory system Acute pain after chest and abdominal surgery can cause increased muscle tone and reduce the total compliance of the respiratory system; patients breathe shallowly and quickly, vital capacity, tidal volume and functional residual capacity are all reduced, alveolar ventilation/perfusion ratio is reduced, and hypoxemia is easy to occur. Due to pain, patients dare not take deep breaths or cough hard, which can easily lead to pneumonia or atelectasis, which is more likely to occur in the elderly. Therefore, postoperative pain is one of the important factors for postoperative pulmonary complications. item Digestive system Chronic pain often causes loss of appetite and digestive dysfunction. Deep pain can also cause symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. item Coagulation mechanism Stress reactions such as acute pain after surgery can change blood viscosity, enhance platelet adhesion function, reduce fibrinolytic function, put the body in a hypercoagulable state, and promote blood formation. item Others Pain can cause a decrease in immune function, which is not conducive to preventing and treating infections and controlling tumor spread. In addition, pain can cause reflex contraction of renal blood vessels, increase the secretion of pituitary antidiuretic hormone, and reduce urine volume. end{enumerate} {(III) Mechanism of pain} Physiological pain is mediated by the sensory nervous system consisting of primary afferent neurons, spinal interneurons and ascending tracts, as well as some supraspinal nerve regions. The trigeminal ganglia and dorsal root ganglia send out high-threshold A$delta$ and C fibers to innervate peripheral tissues (skin, muscles, joints, and internal organs). These specialized primary afferent neurons are called nociceptors, which can convert nociceptive stimuli into action potentials and transmit them to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Figure 24-1). When the surrounding tissue is damaged, the primary afferent neurons are sensitized or directly activated by various thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli (or both), producing various stimuli, including protons, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), neuropeptides (hafnion gene-related peptide, substance P), nerve growth factor, prostaglandin, proinflammatory factors and chemokines begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-249} end{center} Figure 24-1 Pain pathway, etc. These factors can open the cation channels (gated) on the neuronal membrane, causing sodium ions and calcium ions to flow into the end of the pain receptor. The depolarizing current can activate the sodium ion voltage-gated channel, thereby causing the membrane to depolarize and start the burst of action potentials, which are transmitted along the foot process of the sensory nerve to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These impulses are transmitted to the spinal cord neurons, brainstem, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. The transmission of stimulation from nociceptors to spinal neurons and then to the brain is mediated by direct synaptic connections or multiple excitatory or inhibitory interneurons. The central end of nociceptors contains excitatory transmitters, such as glutamate, substance P, and neurotrophic factors, which activate postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), neurokinin, and tyrosine kinase receptors, respectively. Repeated stimulation of nociceptors can sensitize peripheral neurons and central neurons (activity-dependent plasticity). Continuous excitation of nociceptors leads to an increase in the output of spinal neurons, which is called the upswing phenomenon. Subsequently, sensitization persists due to changes in gene transcription of nociceptors and spinal neurons. These genes encode various neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, ion channels, receptors, and signaling molecules. Important examples include NMDA receptors expressed by neurons and glial cells, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), calcium and sodium channels, and cytokines and chemokines. In addition, cell death, nerve growth and collateral sprouting in the peripheral and central nervous systems cause physiological remodeling of neural circuits. {Section 2 Pain Assessment} Pain assessment refers to the use of certain methods to measure the intensity and nature of the patient's pain before and during pain treatment, and to use this as an important basis for formulating treatment plans, selecting the most appropriate drugs and methods, and evaluating treatment effects. Pain assessment may vary depending on different patients, diseases and disease courses. Common pain assessment methods include: begin{enumerate} item Visual analogue scale (VAS) VAS is a simple and effective method for measuring and assessing pain intensity. Draw a straight line of $10 mathrm{~cm}$ on a piece of white paper. The starting point on the left represents \"no pain\", which is 0 points, and the end point on the right represents \"severe pain\", which is 10 points. Patients mark the corresponding parts of the straight line according to the degree of pain they feel. The distance from the \"no pain\" end to the mark is the pain score. VAS is currently the most commonly used method for assessing pain intensity. Item Verbal rating scale (VRS) VRS is based on the patient's main complaint of pain and divides the pain level into the following categories: (1) no pain; (2) mild pain: pain is tolerable and does not interfere with life and sleep; (3) moderate pain: pain is unbearable, interferes with sleep, and requires analgesics; (4) severe pain: severe pain, unbearable, requires analgesics, has serious interference with sleep, and may be accompanied by autonomic nervous system disorders or passive posture. Item Numerical rating scale (NRS) NRS uses the \"Numerical Rating Scale for Pain Level\" (Figure 24-2) to assess the patient's pain level. The 11 numbers \"$0 sim 10$\" are used to represent the intensity of pain, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the most painful. The subject marks one of the numbers according to his or her personal pain experience. According to the corresponding numbers of pain, the pain degree is divided into: mild pain $(1 sim 3)$, moderate pain $(4 sim 6)$, and severe pain $(7 sim 10)$. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-250} end{center} Figure 24-2 Numerical assessment scale for pain degree begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{3} item Facial scale Medical staff conduct pain assessment based on the patient's facial expression when in pain, referring to the \"Facial Expression Pain Rating Scale\" (Figure 24-3). It is suitable for patients with difficulty expressing themselves, such as children, the elderly, and patients with language or cultural differences or other communication barriers. end{enumerate} begin{center} includegraphics[max width= textwidth]{2024_07_09_002a177993bd97d1d6d7g-250(1)} end{center} Figure 24-3 Facial Expression Pain Rating Scale begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Brief Pain Questionnaire (BPQ) BPQ, also known as the brief pain inventory (BPI), quantifies the three factors of sensation, emotion and evaluation. This table includes descriptive words such as the cause of pain, the nature of pain, the impact on life, the location of pain, and uses $ operatorname{VAS}(0 sim 10$ level) to describe the degree of pain, and evaluates from multiple aspects. $ mathrm{BPQ}$ is a fast, multi-dimensional method for measuring and evaluating pain. end{enumerate} In addition to the above methods, physiological indicators and biochemical indicators can also be used for comprehensive evaluation of pain assessment. {Section 3 Commonly used analgesics} Analgesics relieve the sensation of pain by regulating the production of harmful chemicals (such as prostaglandins) or regulating the activation of nerve receptors or ion channels that conduct or transmit noxious stimuli (such as peptides, kinins, monoamine receptors, sodium ion channels). The drugs currently used to treat pain mainly include opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-hydroxytryptamine compounds, antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs. {(I) Opioids} Opioids are the most effective drugs for the treatment of acute severe pain and cancer pain. begin{enumerate} item Mechanism of action Opioids act on seven-helical $ mathrm{G}$ protein-coupled receptors. There are currently three subtypes of opioids end{enumerate}\n",
      "{Chapter 24 Pain Diagnosis and Treatment} Receptors of the class $(mu, delta, kappa)$ were cloned. Opioid receptors are concentrated and can be activated at all levels of nerve axons, including peripheral and central processes of primary sensory neurons (nociceptors), spinal cord (interneurons, projection neurons), brainstem, midbrain and cerebral cortex. All opioid receptors are coupled to $ mathrm{G}$ proteins (mainly $ mathrm{Gi} / mathrm{Go}$), which then inhibit adenylate cyclase, reduce the conductance of voltage-gated cesium channels or open rectifier potassium channels, or any combination of these effects. These effects ultimately lead to a decrease in neuronal activity. Blocked calcium influx inhibits the release of excitatory (nociceptive) neurotransmitters. In addition, opioids inhibit sensory neuron-specific tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels, TRPV1 channels, and excitatory postsynaptic currents induced by glutamate receptors (such as NMDA) in the spinal cord. The result is a reduction in the transmission of noxious stimuli at all levels of nerve axons and a significant reduction in pain sensation. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Commonly used opioids Mainly morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and its derivatives are $ mu$ receptor agonists. Naloxone is a non-selective antagonist of all three receptors. Partial agonists need to bind to more functional receptors than full agonists to produce the same effect. Mixed agonists/antagonists (buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine) can act as agonists at low doses and as antagonists (at the same or different receptor types) at higher doses. The analgesic effect of this type of compound generally has a typical ceiling effect, and when used with pure agonists, it may cause acute withdrawal syndrome. So all three receptors mediate analgesia, accompanied by different side effects. $ mu$ receptors mediate respiratory depression, sedation, reward/euphoria, nausea, urinary retention, bile duct spasm and constipation. $ kappa$ receptors mediate anxiety, aversion, sedation and diuresis, but do not cause constipation. $ delta$ receptors mediate reward/euphoria, respiratory depression and constipation to a lesser extent. Long-term administration of full agonists may lead to tolerance and physiological dependence, and sudden discontinuation of the drug or use of antagonists may lead to withdrawal syndrome. end{enumerate} (1) Morphine: It is a full opioid receptor agonist with a strong analgesic effect, as well as significant sedative and antitussive effects. It is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous and intramuscular injections. $ 60%$ can be absorbed 30 minutes after subcutaneous injection. After absorption, it is rapidly distributed to tissues such as the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. In adults, only a small amount of morphine passes through the blood-brain barrier, but it can produce a highly effective analgesic effect. It can pass through the placenta to reach the fetus. The elimination half-life is 1.7 3 hours, and the protein binding rate is $ 26% sim 36%$. The analgesic effect lasts for $ 4 sim 6$ hours per dose. (2) Pethidine: It is a commonly used synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid analgesic. Its mechanism of action is the same as that of morphine, and its potency is about $1/10 sim 1/8$ of that of morphine. It can produce the same analgesic, sedative and respiratory depressant effects as morphine at equivalent doses, but the latter lasts for a shorter time and does not have the antitussive effect of morphine. It can cause an increase in heart rate. It can be absorbed by oral administration or injection. When taken orally, about $50%$ is first metabolized by the liver, so the blood concentration is low. After oral administration, the blood concentration reaches its peak time of $1 sim$ 2 hours, and two peaks may appear. The protein binding rate is $40% sim 60%$. It is mainly metabolized by the liver into petidinic acid, norpethidine and norpethidine acid hydrolyzate, and then forms a bound or free form with gluconic acid and is excreted through the kidneys. When the urine acidity is high, the parent drug and demethyl derivatives excreted in the urine increase significantly. The elimination half-life is about $3 sim 4$ hours, which increases to more than 7 hours when liver function is impaired. It can pass the placental barrier and be excreted in breast milk in small amounts. The metabolite norpethidine has a central excitatory effect. Therefore, depending on the different routes of administration and the speed of drug metabolism, poisoned patients may experience inhibition or excitement. Adults take $50 sim 100 mathrm{mg}$ each time, intramuscularly or intravenously. (3) Fentanyl: It is a synthetic phenylpiperidine narcotic analgesic. Its analgesic mechanism is similar to that of morphine. It is an opioid receptor agonist with an effect strength 100-180 times that of morphine. It is generally administered by injection in clinical practice. It takes effect 1 minute after intravenous injection, reaches a peak in 4 minutes, and lasts for $30 sim 60 minutes. Intramuscular injection produces analgesia in about 7 to 8 minutes and can last for $1 sim 2$ hours. The intramuscular bioavailability is $67%$, the protein binding rate is $80%$, and the elimination half-life is about 3.7 hours. It is mainly metabolized in the kidney, and metabolites and about $10%$ of the parent drug are excreted by the kidney. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Routes of administration Opioids are administered via peripheral tissues (such as topical or intraarticular administration, especially in inflamed tissues), the central nervous system (such as intrathecal, epidural or intraventricular), and systemic administration (such as intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, sublingual or percutaneous administration). The choice of drug type and dosage form in clinical practice is based on the pharmacokinetics of opioids and side effects related to the route of administration. The dosage depends on the patient's characteristics, the type of pain, and the route of administration. Both systemic and spinal medications can produce similar side effects, which are related to the dose and the intrathecal/systemic redistribution of the drug. When intrathecal medication is used, lipid-soluble drugs are preferred because lipid-soluble drugs tend to be localized in the spinal cord and rarely circulate to the brain with the cerebrospinal fluid. Careful dosage adjustment and close monitoring can minimize the side effects of opioids, and co-administration of drugs (such as antiemetics, laxatives or naloxone) can also be used to prevent and treat corresponding side effects. end{enumerate} {(II) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antipyretics} begin{enumerate} item Mechanism of action Acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and non-acidic antipyretics (such as acetaminophen, antipyrine) can inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX), which is a key enzyme in the metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and hematoxylin. There are two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, which are expressed in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Under the stimulation of injury and inflammatory mediators (such as cytokines and growth factors), both subtypes can be upregulated, resulting in increased prostaglandin release. In the periphery, prostaglandins (mainly prostaglandins $ mathrm{E}_{2}$ ) activate EP receptors to cause ion channel (such as sodium ion channels, TRPV1) phosphorylation, leading to pain receptor sensitization, making nociceptors more sensitive to harmful mechanical stimulation (such as pressure, expansion of hollow organs) and chemical stimulation (such as acidosis, bradykinin, neurotrophic factors) or thermal stimulation. In the spinal cord, prostaglandins $ mathrm{E}_{2}$ inhibit glycinergic inhibitory neurons, enhance the release of excitatory amino acids, and depolarize ascending neurons. These mediators facilitate the generation and transmission of nociceptor stimulation (from the spinal cord to the higher brain centers). Prostaglandin synthesis can be reduced by blocking one (such as selective COX-2 inhibitors) or both cyclooxygenases (non-selective NSAIDs). Eventually, the nociceptors become less responsive to noxious stimuli and neurotransmission in the spinal cord is reduced. Item Commonly used drugs Oral non-selective NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen) or antipyretic analgesics (such as acetaminophen) are usually used to treat mild pain. Some drugs are also available in parenteral, rectal or topical formulations. These drugs block COX-1, leading to blocked production of hemagglutinin and platelet function damage, causing gastrointestinal and other bleeding diseases; reducing prostaglandins with tissue and organ protective effects, causing gastroduodenal ulcers, perforations, gastric vasoconstriction and hepatotoxicity. Selective COX-2 inhibitors can also cause the risk of hemagglutinin formation, myocardial infarction, renal damage, hypertension, stroke and hepatotoxicity. Both types of COX inhibitors have been reported to cause allergic reactions. Acetaminophen has relatively weak anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet activity, and is mainly used for osteoarthritis, headache and fever. end{enumerate} (1) Aspirin: Also known as acetylsalicylic acid, it is the most widely used antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, and is often used as a standard drug for evaluating other analgesics. It mainly produces antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic and anti-platelet aggregation effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the body. It takes effect about 30 minutes after oral administration and lasts for $3 sim 5$ hours. When used for analgesic treatment, adults take $0.3 sim 1.0 mathrm{~g}$ each time, once every 3 to 4 hours, and the total amount per day does not exceed $3.6 mathrm{~g}$; children take $10 sim 20 mathrm{~g}/mathrm{kg}$, once every 6 hours. Aspirin can be used for mild or moderate pain accompanied by inflammatory reactions, such as headache, toothache, neuralgia, muscle pain and menstrual pain. It is also used to reduce fever for colds and influenza. (2) Parecoxib (TeNai): It is a selective COX-2 inhibitor and an anti-inflammatory analgesic drug belonging to the coxib class. Parecoxib is a prodrug of valdecoxib. After intravenous or intramuscular injection, it is hydrolyzed by liver enzymes and rapidly converted into a pharmacologically active substance, valdecoxib. It takes effect 7 sim 13$ minutes after intravenous injection and lasts for 6 sim 12$ hours. {(III) 5-hydroxytryptamine drugs} begin{enumerate} item Mechanism of action 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter in the sympathetic nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and platelets. 5-HT receptors are expressed in nerve tissues and blood vessels at all levels. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, 5-HT neurons are part of the endogenous pain suppression. Except for $5- mathrm{HT}_{3}$ (a ligand-gated ion channel), all other $5- mathrm{HT}$ receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. $5- mathrm{HT}_{1 B / 1 D}$ agonists (triptans) are effective in treating neurovascular headaches (migraine, cluster headache). The occurrence of migraine is related to the release of neuropeptides (such as calcitonin gene-related peptide) from the trigeminal nerve that controls the meninges and intracranial blood vessels, leading to vasodilation, inflammatory response, and pain. Triptans inhibit neurogenic inflammation by acting on the 5$ mathrm{HT}_{1 D}$ receptors of the trigeminal afferent system. Other sites of action include thalamic neurons and the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain. $5- mathrm{HT}_{1 B}$ receptor agonists can constrict meningeal vessels and coronary arteries, while highly selective $5- mathrm{HT}_{11}$ agonists and $5- mathrm{HT}_{1 mathrm{E}}$ agonists may not cause vasoconstriction. item Commonly used drugs Triptans can be administered orally, subcutaneously, or by nasal drops, and are commonly used to treat migraines. Clinical doses can cause coronary artery constriction by $20 %$, and are contraindicated in patients with risk factors such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases. When triptans are used in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, provolone, cimetidine, drugs metabolized by hepatic P450, and P-glycoprotein inhibitors, significant drug interactions may occur. end{enumerate} {(IV) Antiepileptic drugs} Mechanism of action Antiepileptic drugs are used to treat neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nervous system damage (such as diabetes, herpes) or central nervous system damage (such as stroke). The pathogenesis of neuropathic pain includes: ectopic activity of nociceptors sensitized by regenerating nerves; reactivation of \"silent\" nociceptors; or spontaneous neuronal activity, or any combination of these mechanisms, which can cause multi-level neuronal sensitization. Antiepileptic drugs are divided into four categories according to their different mechanisms of action: (1) drugs that block pathologically activated voltage-sensitive sodium ion channels, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and topiramate; (2) drugs that block voltage-dependent calcium channels, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; (3) drugs that inhibit the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters, such as gabapentin and lamotrigine; (4) drugs that increase the activity of GABA receptors, such as topiramate. Antidementia drugs are commonly used to treat neuropathic pain and prevent migraines, often in combination with antidepressants. The most common side effects are mental disorders (sleepiness, dizziness, cognitive impairment, fatigue) and motor dysfunction (ataxia). They are especially common in elderly patients. Other serious side effects include hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and severe skin and blood reactions. Blood concentrations of these drugs should be monitored during use.\n",
      "{(V) Antidepressants} begin{enumerate} item Mechanism of action Antidepressants are used to treat neuropathic pain and headaches. According to the mechanism of action, tricyclic antidepressants are divided into three categories: non-selective norepinephrine $/ 5- mathrm{HT}$ reuptake inhibitors (amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, venlafaxine), preferential norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (desipramine, nortriptyline), and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, paroxetine, fluoxetine). By blocking the reuptake effect, it excites endogenous monoamine pain inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord and brain. In addition, it also has the effects of antagonizing NMDA receptors, increasing endogenous opioid levels, blocking sodium ion channels and opening potassium ion channels, thereby inhibiting peripheral and central nervous system sensitization. item Side effects Mainly include sedation, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness and blurred vision. In order to achieve better therapeutic effects and avoid drug toxicity, it is often necessary to monitor the blood concentration of tricyclic antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants block the ion channels of the heart and can cause arrhythmias. They are contraindicated in patients with recent myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac decompensation. end{enumerate} {(VI) Topical analgesics} Topical NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, capsaicin, local anesthetics, and opioids have certain analgesic effects. Topical medication can achieve the best concentration of the drug at the site of pain, avoid excessive blood concentrations, systemic side effects, drug interactions, and simplify the process of gradually increasing the drug to the therapeutic dose range. begin{enumerate} item Topical NSAIDs are commonly used to treat acute and chronic pain. Their preparations include emulsions, gels, softeners, etc. Short-term topical NSAIDs can effectively treat chronic musculoskeletal pain, but have no significant effect on osteoarthritis. During use, attention should be paid to local rashes and itching. item Capsaicin Capsaicin emulsions at $0.025%$ or $0.075%$ are commonly used. They are mainly used to treat postherpetic neuralgia, postmastectomy syndrome, osteoarthritis and a series of neuropathic pain syndromes. When applied topically, it relieves pain by interacting with nociceptive sensory neurons via capsaicin receptors (TRPV1). However, $80%$ of patients experience burning sensation or itching during use, which can be desensitized after repeated use. The mechanism may be that capsaicin activates sensory neurons, promoting the release and depletion of $ mathrm{P}$ substances, or that the neurotoxic effect of capsaicin causes the degeneration of fine fibers in sensory nerves, which gradually eliminates the symptoms. Capsaicin at high concentrations of $(5% sim 10%)$ can be used in conjunction with local anesthesia to reduce its side effects and enhance the therapeutic effect. item Topical preparations of local anesthetics Commonly used drug dosage forms include patches, syrups and gels. It can be used to relieve postherpetic neuralgia and allodynia, diabetic polyneuropathy, post-mastectomy and post-thoracotomy syndrome, and the treatment and prevention of pain in the oral, respiratory, digestive and urethral mucosa. Topical preparations of local anesthetics work by blocking the sodium channels of primary afferent neurons. After sodium channel blockage, the impulses generated by normal and damaged sensory neurons are reduced. Spontaneous or ectopic discharges of neurons promote the formation of chronic neuropathic pain, and changes in the expression, distribution and function of axonal ion channels increase sensitivity to local anesthetics. Therefore, even local anesthetics at concentrations lower than those required to completely block nerve conduction can achieve good analgesic effects. item Topical opioid preparations Topical opioids (such as gels) are used to treat pain caused by skin ulcers, cystitis, cancer-related oral mucositis, corneal abrasions, bone injuries, etc. Intra-articular injections of morphine can produce analgesia in patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Its mechanism of action is that topical or local injection of opioids can activate opioid receptors on primary afferent neurons, inhibiting calcium ions, sodium ions and TRPV1 currents activated by inflammatory mediators. Subsequently, the excitability of nociceptors, the propagation of action potentials, and the release of proinflammatory neuropeptides (such as $ mathrm{P}$ substances) at sensory nerve endings are inhibited, resulting in analgesic or (and) anti-inflammatory effects. Upregulating and accelerating the distal transport of opioid receptors in sensory neurons, increasing the coupling of peripheral opioid receptors with $ mathrm{G}$ proteins, and destroying the perineurial barrier, thereby facilitating the binding of agonists to opioid receptors, is also one of the mechanisms. end{enumerate} {(VII) Other analgesics and adjuvant drugs} begin{enumerate} item Local anesthetics Patients with chronic pain syndrome can choose local anesthetics, including topical, oral, intravenous, trigger point injection, and regional blockade. Systemic medications (such as oral mexiletine) have different effects in various neurological diseases. Mexiletine can be used as a third-line medication for patients with diabetic neuropathy. Serious side effects of local anesthetics include arrhythmias, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and systemic toxicity of local anesthetics. item $ alpha_{2}$ adrenergic agonists Commonly used drugs are clonidine. $ alpha_{2}$ adrenergic receptors are $ mathrm{G}$ protein-coupled receptors with similar effects to opioids. By opening potassium ion channels, inhibiting presynaptic calcium ion channels, inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, reducing neurotransmitter release, and reducing postsynaptic transmission, an inhibitory effect is produced. In patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), neuropathic pain, and cancer pain, epidural or systemic clonidine can produce analgesic effects, but be alert to adverse drug reactions such as excessive sedation, hypertension, and bradycardia. item Baclofen It can activate presynaptic and postsynaptic $ mathrm{GABA}_{ mathrm{B}}$ receptors, resulting in decreased excitatory nerve conduction and increased inhibitory nerve conduction. It is commonly used for trigeminal neuralgia and central neuralgia. The most common side effects are drowsiness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal discomfort. item Antiemetics Nausea is a common side effect of analgesics (especially opioids) and a common symptom in cancer patients. The mechanisms of action of antiemetics include effects on the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone, gastrointestinal irritation or failure, vestibular and cortical mechanisms, and taste and smell. Commonly used drugs include gastrointestinal motility drugs (metoclopramide), phenothiazines (levomepromazine), dopamine receptor antagonists (haloperidol), 5-HT antagonists (ondansetron) and antihistamines (cyclizine), as well as methylnaltrexone (the only peripheral opioid antagonist), dexamethasone (unclear mechanism), anticholinergic scopolamine and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. Antiemetics with different mechanisms of action can be used in combination. item Laxatives include hyperosmotic laxatives that affect volume formation and change osmotic pressure, colonic irrigation drugs, gastrointestinal motility drugs, and opioid antagonists. The use of tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, anticonvulsants, diuretics, iron supplements and opioids can all cause constipation. Providing adequate fluid intake, fiber-rich nutritional support, and increasing gastrointestinal motility are all non-drug methods to prevent constipation. In severe cases, lactulose, senna, and polyethylene glycol are often the first choice. However, lactulose should be avoided in elderly patients with insufficient fluid intake and patients with advanced cancer. If ineffective, liquid paraffin or bisacodyl can be used in combination with the first-choice drug, and prokinetic drugs such as metoclopramide can also be added to treat intractable constipation. For opioid-related constipation, opioid receptor antagonists can be selected for treatment. end{enumerate} {Section 4 Acute Pain Treatment} {I. Treatment Methods for Postoperative Pain} There are many options for postoperative pain treatment, including systemic analgesics and regional (i.e., intraspinal and peripheral) analgesia techniques. According to the patient's wishes, the pros and cons of each treatment method are actively and individually evaluated, and clinicians can choose the most appropriate postoperative analgesia for each patient. {(I) Systemic analgesia administration route} begin{enumerate} item Oral administration The choice of oral analgesics is suitable for drugs with high bioavailability and patients who are suitable for oral administration after surgery. end{enumerate} {Chapter 24 Pain Diagnosis and Treatment} The disease itself, surgical trauma, and anesthesia can inhibit gastrointestinal motility. It is generally believed that oral drugs have delayed absorption, slow onset, and poor effects. Therefore, oral medications have poor analgesic effects in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain and are not recommended. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Intramuscular injection Intramuscular injection is a classic method that has been used in clinical practice. Commonly used drugs include pethidine, tramadol, buprofezin hydrochloride, etc. However, the absorption of drugs at the injection site depends on the lipid solubility of the drug and the local blood flow. After intramuscular injection of morphine and pethidine, the plasma concentration of different patients can vary by as much as $3 sim 5$ times, and the peak effect time of the drug varies from $4 sim 108$ minutes, which is very different. The blood drug concentration fluctuates greatly, resulting in incomplete analgesia or complications and injection pain. Therefore, intramuscular injection is becoming less and less common. item Intravenous injection Single intravenous injection is the fastest way to achieve effective analgesia. Continuous intravenous infusion can reduce fluctuations in drug concentration and is effective in continuously relieving postoperative pain. Commonly used drugs include morphine, fentanyl, pethidine and hydromorphone. The use of medium and long half-life opioids may cause accumulation, leading to serious complications such as respiratory depression. In order to improve the analgesic effect and safety of continuous intravenous administration, patient-controlled analgesia is often used. end{enumerate} {(II) Regional analgesia techniques} Commonly used are spinal (mainly epidural) and peripheral regional analgesia techniques. In general, the analgesic effect of epidural and peripheral techniques (especially when local anesthetics are used) is better than that of systemic opioids. However, the use of these techniques also has associated risks, and clinicians should evaluate the pros and cons for each patient in order to adopt the most appropriate spinal or peripheral regional analgesia technique. begin{enumerate} item Neuraxial single-dose opioids Single intrathecal or epidural injections of opioids are effective as sole or adjunctive analgesia. Neuraxially administered lipophilic opioids, such as fentanyl and sufentanil, have a rapid onset of analgesia, are rapidly cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid, and have few side effects. item Continuous epidural analgesia is a safe and effective treatment for acute postoperative pain. Postoperative epidural analgesia is superior to systemic opioids. Commonly used epidural analgesics include local anesthetics, opioids, and a combination of both, with clonidine being a common adjunctive agent. item Peripheral regional analgesia Peripheral regional analgesia techniques, either as a single injection or as a continuous infusion, are superior to systemic opioids in terms of analgesia. Various wound infiltration and peripheral regional analgesia techniques (e.g., brachial plexus, lumbar plexus, femoral nerve, sciatic nerve, and cutaneous nerve blocks) may enhance postoperative analgesia. Peripheral regional analgesia is superior to systemic opioids in some aspects (i.e., better analgesic effect, fewer opioid-related side effects), and reduces intraspinal damage. end{enumerate} {(III) Patient controlled analgesia (PCA)} PCA is developed by combining the concept of on-demand analgesia proposed in the past two decades with microcomputer technology. That is, the patient can press the drug administration button of the PCA device by himself to inject analgesics according to the set dose, thereby achieving analgesic effect. It makes up for the problems of insufficient analgesia and neglect of individual differences in patients in traditional analgesic methods, as well as the difficulty in maintaining stable blood drug concentration. The PCA device includes an injection spring, an automatic control device, an infusion pipeline and a one-way valve to prevent reflux. begin{enumerate} item classification (1) Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA); (2) Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). item Common terms (1) Loading dose, which refers to the blood drug concentration required for PCA to quickly reach analgesia, that is, the amount of drug required for the minimum effective analgesic concentration; (2) Bolus dose, which refers to the additional analgesic dose given to the patient due to incomplete analgesia; (3) Lock-out time, which refers to the interval between two single effective doses, during which the PCA device does not execute the single dose instruction; (4) Basal infusion, which is the set continuous dose of the PCA device. item Notes There are many types of drug formulations for PCA. PCIA is mainly based on narcotic analgesics, commonly used morphine, fentanyl or tramadol. PCEA is a combination of local anesthetics and narcotic analgesics, commonly used $0.1% sim 0.2%$ bupivacaine plus a small amount of fentanyl or morphine. Whether using PCIA or PCEA, the physician should explain the purpose of use and the correct operation method to the patient in advance so that the patient can relieve pain according to his or her own wishes. At the beginning of PCA, a loading dose is often given as a basis, and then maintained with a background dose. In case of incomplete analgesia, the patient can give a single dose on his or her own initiative to obtain a satisfactory analgesic effect. During this period, the physician should reasonably adjust the single dose, lockout time and background dose according to the condition and the effect of the medication, in order to prevent insufficient analgesia or overdose of medication, improve the quality of analgesia, and ensure safety. end{enumerate} {(IV) Other technologies} Other non-pharmacological technologies such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture and psychological methods can be used to relieve postoperative pain.\n",
      "{(V) Multimodal analgesia} Postoperative multimodal analgesia (multimodal analgesia) technology is the combined use of analgesics with different mechanisms of action, or different analgesic measures, to produce analgesia through multiple mechanisms, in order to obtain better analgesic effects and minimize side effects. This represents the main development direction of postoperative analgesia technology. {II. Labor analgesia} Labor analgesia (analgesia for labor) refers to the analgesia technology and vital sign monitoring provided by anesthesiologists during labor to provide safe and comfortable delivery conditions for mothers and babies. There are many ways to provide labor analgesia, including systemic drug analgesia, inhaled anesthetic analgesia, spinal block analgesia, psychological midwifery, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), etc. In addition, other regional anesthesia techniques, such as caudal or cervical block techniques, are now less used. {(I) Systemic drug analgesia} Opioids are the most commonly used systemic drugs in labor. All opioids have side effects to varying degrees, including respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and changes in psychiatric symptoms ranging from euphoria to excessive sedation. Due to the physical and chemical properties of opioids, they can all cross the placenta, which may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. However, appropriate use of opioids can effectively relieve labor pain in a short period of time. {(II) Inhalation analgesia} Inhalation analgesia refers to the use of inhaled anesthetics at low concentrations to relieve pain during labor. begin{enumerate} item Nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture Nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture (a $50:50$ mixture of $ mathrm{N}_{2} mathrm{O} / mathrm{O}_{2}$) is used as a sole analgesic during labor or as an adjunct to systemic and regional techniques. Side effects include dizziness, nausea, and restlessness. The strongest analgesic effect occurs $45 sim 60$ seconds after administration. Therefore, the best time to inhale the nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture is when the uterus begins to contract, and to stop administering it after the uterine contraction reaches its peak. item Inhalation anesthetics Desflurane $(0.2 %)$, Enflurane and Isoflurane $(0.2 % sim 0.25 %)$ have also been successfully used for labor analgesia, with an effectiveness similar to that of inhaled nitrous oxide. Recent studies have shown that sevoflurane is effective and well-accepted for labor analgesia. Compared with nitrous oxide, sevoflurane can produce better analgesia, stronger sedation and fewer side effects. end{enumerate} {(III) Regional analgesia techniques} Various regional techniques are used in obstetric anesthesia to provide the best analgesia with the least inhibitory effect on the mother and fetus. These techniques are the most effective means of analgesia during labor and delivery. Compared with intravenous and inhalation techniques, regional techniques are more flexible, more effective and less inhibitory. Regional analgesia does not produce drug-induced suppression of the mother and fetus. The most commonly used regional techniques in labor are epidural, spinal, or combined epidural-spinal analgesia techniques. begin{enumerate} item Assessment and preparation The patient should first be asked about the medical and delivery history, perform a physical examination, and assess the airway. The delivery plan and fetal health should also be documented during the preoperative assessment. Informed consent must be obtained from the patient, and the anesthesiologist should explain the procedure and possible complications. item Continuous epidural analgesia is currently the most commonly used method for labor analgesia. Low-dose local anesthetics or opioids are used in the first stage of labor to maintain sensory blockade of $ mathrm{T}_{10} sim mathrm{L}_{1}$ segments. Further measures may be required to achieve sacral block in the late first and second stages of labor. Lumbar epidural analgesia can relieve pain without motor block, reduce maternal catecholamine levels, and quickly achieve surgical anesthesia when necessary. Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine are used in concentrations of 0. $0625 % sim 0.125 %$, alone or in combination with opioids. Adding adrenaline can improve the quality of analgesia by reducing vascular uptake and systemic absorption of local anesthetics and directly stimulating spinal cord receptors. From the mother's perspective, continuous infusion ensures continuous and effective comfort. Contraindications include maternal refusal, significant maternal coagulation disorder, puncture site infection and maternal hemodynamic instability. item Subarachnoid block A single injection of local anesthetic or opioid into the subarachnoid space provides rapid and effective analgesia. It is particularly suitable for women who are in premature labor or in great pain. item Combined spinal-epidural block analgesia is widely used in obstetrics and can provide ideal analgesia for women. It is characterized by effective and rapid analgesia with minimal toxicity or motor block damage. Spinal-epidural block analgesia can be performed by two-point puncture or one-point puncture. The operation method is detailed in Chapter 4. item Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is a safe and effective analgesic technique that can provide effective labor analgesia and excellent patient satisfaction. It reduces the total amount of local anesthetic used, thereby reducing side effects. Usually, after analgesia is established by subarachnoid or epidural injection, the catheter is connected to the PCEA device, and the patient can then control the dosage of the drug according to their needs. end{enumerate} {Section 5 Chronic Pain Treatment} Chronic pain refers to pain that persists for more than the normal course of an acute disease or the normal time required for injury healing, or pain recurrences that persist for more than 1 month. Its formation and persistence not only cause multiple harms to patients but also to society. Therefore, the treatment of chronic pain is not only a medical problem, but also a social problem. At the same time, the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain requires a multidisciplinary approach. {(I) Scope of diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain} The diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain mainly include: (1) Headache: migraine, tension headache; (neck and shoulder pain and back and leg pain: cervical spondylosis, cervical myofasciitis, frozen shoulder, lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spondylosis, lumbar myofasciitis, lumbar muscle strain; (3) Chronic injury diseases of the limbs: synovitis, stenosing tenosynovitis, ganglion cyst, lateral epicondylitis; (4) Neuralgia: trigeminal neuralgia, intercostal neuralgia, phantom limb pain, postherpetic neuralgia; (5) Peripheral vascular disease: thromboangiitis obliterans, Raynaud's syndrome; (6) Cancer pain; 7) Psychological pain. {(II) Common treatment methods} begin{enumerate} item Drug treatment Drug treatment is the most basic and most commonly used method for pain treatment. Generally, patients with chronic pain need to take medication for a long time. In order to maintain the lowest effective plasma drug concentration, regular and quantitative medication should be used. If used when pain strikes, a large dose is often required and the duration is short, resulting in less than ideal results. Commonly used drugs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and antidepressants. item Nerve block Nerve block is the main treatment for chronic pain. Long-acting local anesthetics are generally used. For cancer pain and intractable headaches such as trigeminal neuralgia, anhydrous ethanol or 5% to 10% phenol can be used to achieve long-term analgesia. Commonly used nerve blocks include brachial plexus block, cervical plexus block and intercostal nerve block. In addition, pain in many diseases is related to the sympathetic nerves and can be treated through sympathetic nerve block. Commonly used sympathetic nerve block methods include stellate ganglion block and lumbar sympathetic nerve block. item Intraspinal injection Intraspinal injection can be injected through the subarachnoid space or the epidural space. Absolute ethanol or $5% sim 10%$phenol glycerol is administered through the subarachnoid space to treat advanced cancer pain; Common drugs for epidural injection include glucocorticoids, opioids and local anesthetics. item pain point injection Injection of drugs at local fixed tender points, $1%$ lidocaine or $0.25%$ bupivacaine $1 sim$ $4 mathrm{ml}$ is injected into each pain point, plus $0.5 mathrm{ml}(12.5 mathrm{mg})$ prednisolone suspension, $1 sim$ 2$ times a week, $3 sim$ 5$ times as a course of treatment, with good results. item physical therapy is widely used in pain treatment, and there are many types, commonly used are electrotherapy, phototherapy, magnetic therapy and paraffin therapy. Its main functions are anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antispasmodic, improving local blood circulation, softening scars and stimulating nerves and muscles. item Psychological treatment Psychological factors play an important role in chronic pain. Supportive treatment in psychological treatment is that medical staff use explanations, encouragement, comfort and assurance to help patients eliminate negative psychological factors such as anxiety, depression and fear, so as to mobilize patients' subjective initiative, enhance the body's ability to resist pain, and actively cooperate with treatment. In addition, there are hypnosis and suggestion therapy, cognitive therapy and biofeedback therapy. item Occupational therapy Occupational therapists guide patients to overcome the limitations of pain on activities and achieve the goals of daily life activities. The initial assessment includes: inquiries about the patient's work history and workplace, family life and daily activities, as well as physical examinations to clarify the range of motion and possible movement disorders or deformities that hinder recovery. The main goal of treatment is to reduce pain and the loss of function caused by it, promote the restoration of optimal function in daily life, encourage the establishment of meaningful family, social and work relationships, so as to increase patients' self-esteem, restore their ability to take care of themselves, and enable them to overcome pain and achieve their best state in work and entertainment. end{enumerate} {Section 6 Cancer Pain Treatment} Pain is one of the most common symptoms of cancer patients and seriously affects their quality of life. The incidence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer patients is about $25%$; the incidence of pain in advanced cancer patients is about $60% sim 80%$, of which $1/3$ of patients suffer from severe pain. If cancer pain (abbreviated as cancer pain) is not relieved, it can aggravate the patient's anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite and other symptoms. In severe cases, it affects the patient's daily activities, self-care ability, communication ability and overall quality of life. {(I) Treatment principles for cancer pain} Cancer pain should adopt the principle of comprehensive treatment. According to the patient's condition and physical condition, effective analgesic treatment methods should be used to continuously and effectively eliminate pain, prevent and control adverse drug reactions, and reduce the psychological burden caused by pain and treatment, so as to maximize the patient's quality of life. {(II) Treatment methods} Treatment methods for cancer pain include: etiological treatment, drug analgesic treatment and non-drug treatment. begin{enumerate} item Etiological treatment Treatment is aimed at the cause of cancer pain. The main causes of cancer pain are cancer itself, complications, etc. Therefore, anticancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, may relieve cancer pain. end{enumerate}\n",
      "{2. Drug analgesia} (1) Principles: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) three-step analgesia treatment guidelines for cancer pain, the five basic principles of drug analgesia for cancer pain are as follows: 1) Oral administration: Oral administration is the most common route of administration. For those who are not suitable for oral administration, other methods of administration can be used, such as subcutaneous injection of morphine, patient-controlled analgesia, and more convenient methods such as transdermal patches. 2) Stepped medication: refers to the targeted selection of analgesics of different strengths according to the patient's pain level (Figure 24-4). (1) Mild pain: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used; (2) Moderate pain: Weak opioids can be used, and NSAIDs can be used in combination; (3) Severe pain: Strong opioids can be used, and NSAIDs can be used in combination. When using opioids, the combination of NSAIDs can enhance the analgesic effect of opioids and reduce the dosage of opioids. If a good analgesic effect can be achieved and there are no serious adverse reactions, strong opioids can also be considered for mild and moderate pain. If the patient is diagnosed with neuropathic pain, tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants should be the first choice. 3) Timed medication: refers to the regular administration of analgesics at prescribed time intervals. Timed medication helps maintain a stable and effective blood concentration. At present, controlled-release drugs are increasingly used clinically, emphasizing the use of controlled-release opioids as the basic medication for analgesia. When titration and breakthrough pain occur, immediate-release opioids can be given for symptomatic treatment. 4) Individualized medication: refers to the formulation of an individualized medication plan according to the patient's condition and the drug dose required for cancer pain relief. When using opioids, there is no ideal standard dosage for opioids due to individual differences. Sufficient dosages should be used according to the patient's condition to relieve pain. At the same time, the nature of neuropathic pain should be identified and the possibility of combined medication should be considered. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Notes: Patients using analgesics should be closely monitored, their pain relief and body response should be closely observed, the interaction of combined drug use should be noted, and necessary measures should be taken in a timely manner to minimize adverse drug reactions, in order to improve the patient's quality of life. end{enumerate} (2) Drug selection and use: Analgesics and auxiliary drugs should be reasonably selected according to the degree and nature of cancer patients' pain, the treatment they are receiving, and concomitant diseases. The dosage and frequency of medication should be adjusted individually to prevent and treat adverse reactions, in order to obtain the best analgesic effect and reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions. 1) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: They are the basic drugs for cancer pain treatment. Different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have similar mechanisms of action, with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. They are often used to relieve mild pain, or combined with opioids to relieve moderate to severe pain. Common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used in cancer pain treatment include: ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen, indomethacin, celecoxib, etc. Common adverse reactions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include: peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet dysfunction, renal or liver damage, etc. The occurrence of adverse reactions is related to the dosage and duration of medication. 2) Opioid drugs: They are the first choice for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. At present, the short-acting opioid drugs commonly used in clinical cancer pain treatment are morphine immediate-release tablets, and the long-acting opioid drugs are morphine sustained-release tablets, oxycodone sustained-release tablets, fentanyl transdermal patches, etc. For the treatment of chronic cancer pain, opioid receptor agonists are recommended. When opioid analgesics are used for a long time, oral administration is the preferred route of administration. Transdermal absorption can be used when there is a clear indication. Subcutaneous injection can also be used temporarily. Patient-controlled analgesia can be used when necessary. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Adjuvant medication: Adjuvant analgesics include: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and local anesthetics. Adjuvant medications can enhance the analgesic effect of opioids or produce direct analgesic effects. Adjuvant analgesics are often used to assist in the treatment of neuropathic pain, bone pain, and visceral pain. end{enumerate} begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Non-drug treatments Non-drug treatments for cancer pain treatment mainly include: interventional therapy, acupuncture, physical therapy such as transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation, cognitive-behavioral training, and social and psychological support therapy. Appropriate use of non-drug therapy can be a beneficial supplement to drug analgesia. When used in combination with analgesic drug therapy, it can increase the effect of analgesia. Interventional therapy refers to interventional treatment measures such as nerve block, neurolysis, percutaneous vertebroplasty, nerve-destructive surgery, nerve stimulation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Drug administration through intraspinal and plexus blocks can effectively control cancer pain through single nerve block, reduce gastrointestinal reactions caused by opioids, and reduce the dosage of opioids. Before interventional therapy, a comprehensive assessment should be made of the patient's expected survival time and physical condition, whether there are indications for anti-tumor treatment, and the potential benefits and risks of interventional therapy. end{enumerate} {Chapter 25 Drug Dependence and Withdrawal} Drug dependence or addiction is a chronic, recurrent encephalopathy caused by long-term abuse of drugs on the central nervous system, resulting in abnormal adaptability or plasticity changes, which in turn causes compulsive drug use and drug-taking behavior. Drug dependence not only directly harms the physical and mental health of the dependent individual, but also becomes a serious social problem. {Section 1 Introduction} {I. Basic concepts related to drug dependence} begin{enumerate} item Drug tolerance refers to the phenomenon that after long-term use of a certain drug, the effect of the drug gradually weakens or even disappears, or the drug dose needs to be continuously increased to obtain the same drug effect. Drug tolerance often leads to excessive use of toxic drugs by drug users, thus endangering their lives. item Drug dependence is a mental state caused by the interaction between drugs and the body, and sometimes also includes physical states, showing a compulsive behavior and other reactions to use the drug continuously or regularly in order to feel its mental effects or to avoid the discomfort caused by stopping the drug. item Physiological dependence refers to an adaptation state caused by repeated use of drugs with dependence potential. Its characteristic is that once the drug user stops taking the drug, a series of physiological function disturbances will occur, namely withdrawal syndrome. item Withdrawal syndrome refers to a series of clinical symptoms and signs of psychological and physiological dysfunction caused by abruptly stopping or reducing the use of addictive drugs, or using antagonists of addictive drugs (such as naloxone for heroin addiction). Withdrawal syndrome is one of the causes of relapse. item Psychological dependence refers to a desire for drug euphoria in people. This strong desire that cannot be controlled drives abusers to use drugs periodically or continuously. item Positive reinforcement effect refers to the reinforcing effect that can cause euphoria or mental pleasure and prompt people or animals to actively seek drugs. It is also called reward effect. It is the basis of psychological dependence. item Negative reinforcement effect refers to the reinforcing effect that can cause mental unhappiness or physical discomfort (such as withdrawal symptoms) and prompt people or animals to passively accept drugs (or seek stimulation) to avoid such discomfort. It is the basis of physiological dependence and can promote drug abuse. item Detoxification refers to a treatment process that can gradually remove drugs from the body, reduce subjective discomfort, reduce observable or measurable withdrawal symptoms, and prevent health risks caused by the sudden cessation of drug use. item Relapse refers to the resumption of previous drug use and drug-taking behaviors after a period of time after stopping the use of addictive drugs through clinical detoxification treatment or other means (such as compulsory drug rehabilitation) and other reasons (such as detention and reeducation through labor), and the formation of drug dependence again. end{enumerate} {II. Causes of drug dependence} The main reason for drug dependence is the long-term abuse of addictive drugs, which leads to a series of structural and functional changes in the brain. There is currently no effective method or drug to treat drug dependence. Therefore, the study of its cause will be of great significance to the prevention of drug dependence. The cause of drug dependence is complex and is the result of the interaction of psychological, biological and sociological factors. It is generally believed that the interaction between environmental factors that lead to drug dependence and genetic susceptibility to drug dependence is the main reason for the formation of drug dependence. begin{enumerate} item Genetic factors Many people have experienced the euphoria produced by neuropsychiatric drugs, but only a few develop into drug addicts, indicating that drug dependence has a genetic susceptibility. It is estimated that almost half of drug dependence is caused by genetic factors. Molecular biological research suggests that gene polymorphisms such as the neurotransmitter/receptor system on which addictive drugs act and the enzyme system that affects drug metabolism form the genetic basis of drug dependence susceptibility. item Social factors Socioeconomic factors in the family and living environment, high-intensity work pressure, peer pressure, an environment where addictive drugs are easily available, a social environment that is tolerant of drug dependence, and sexual openness are the main social factors that affect the formation of drug dependence and relapse. end{enumerate} {3. Personality factors} (1) Personality defects, such as weak will, dependence on others, lack of self-control and self-confidence; aggressive personality, antisocial personality disorder, etc. (2) Strong curiosity, which prompts individuals to try the pleasurable effects produced by addictive drugs. (3) Mental or emotional disorders, such as depression, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity disorder, etc. (4) Physical diseases, such as physical discomfort, pain, insomnia, etc. caused by long-term medication. {III. Classification of drug dependence} begin{enumerate} item Physical dependence is mainly an adaptation state of the body to the long-term use of addictive drugs, including tolerance and withdrawal symptoms after stopping the drug. item Psychological dependence refers to a special mental effect produced by the drug's action on the central nervous system, which is manifested as a strong desire for drugs and compulsive drug-taking behavior. end{enumerate} {Section 2 Classification of addictive drugs and their targets} {I. Classification of addictive drugs} According to the International Drug Control Convention, addictive drugs are divided into three categories: narcotic drugs, psychotropic drugs and others. begin{enumerate} item Narcotic drugs include opioids, cocaine, marijuana, etc. item Psychotropic drugs include sedatives, hypnotic and antianxiety drugs, central nervous system stimulants, hallucinogens, etc. item Others include ethanol, tobacco, volatile organic solvents, etc. end{enumerate} {2.

      "{I. Neuroanatomical basis related to drug dependence} Many parts of the central nervous system are involved in the formation and development of drug dependence, and there are obvious differences in the central nervous system parts that mediate physiological dependence and psychological dependence. The brain areas involved in physiological dependence include the locus coeruleus, the gray matter around the aqueduct, the medial thalamus, the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the medullary giant cell reticular nucleus, the spinal cord, etc. The most important anatomical basis for the formation of psychological drug dependence is the midbrain dopamine reward system, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) rich in dopamine neurons and its projection area, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Among them, the DA projection of VTA-NAc is currently considered to be the main pathway for encoding the reward effect of dependent drugs. Relapse is due to the fact that drug addicts form strong memories of the reward effect of dependent drugs and the environmental cues around them when taking drugs. Therefore, brain areas related to emotional experience and memory formation and head fixation, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, also play an important role in drug dependence. {II. Neurotransmitter/receptor systems involved in drug dependence} Neurotransmitter/receptor systems are the material basis for realizing the functions of neural circuits. Almost all neurotransmitter/receptor systems are involved in drug dependence to varying degrees, among which dopamine and glutamate systems are the most studied. begin{enumerate} item Dopamine (DA) Stimulating the dopamine reward system can achieve three effects: activating motor behavior, motivating learning, and rekindling secondary motivational characteristics. Under physiological conditions, the midbrain dopamine reward system is involved in natural reward effects such as food and sex. A variety of addictive drugs can directly or indirectly activate dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, increase the release of dopamine in its target area, especially in the nucleus accumbens, and dopamine acts on dopamine receptors 1 on the nucleus accumbens neurons, thereby producing euphoria and mental satisfaction, which leads to psychological dependence. item Glutamate (glutamic acid) Both the dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and the dopaminergic nerve endings in the nucleus accumbens receive projections from glutamatergic neurons in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. In the process of drug dependence, glutamate directly or indirectly regulates the function of the dopamine system. Glutamate transmitted to the ventral tegmental area increases the excitability of dopaminergic neuron cell bodies and promotes the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens; glutamate transmitted to the nucleus accumbens also promotes the release of dopamine through presynaptic mechanisms. Glutamate projections from the anterior amygdala and frontal cortex to the ventral tegmental area and (or) nucleus accumbens are indispensable for drug-related cues, stress and relapse behavior. end{enumerate} {III. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of drug dependence} begin{enumerate} item Cellular mechanisms The excitability of VTA dopamine neurons that produce and release dopamine is key to regulating the function of the midbrain dopamine reward system. In vivo, VTA dopamine neurons usually have two spontaneous discharge modes, namely slow-frequency single discharge and high-frequency burst discharge. The burst discharge mode produces more dopamine neurotransmitter release in its projection target area than the single discharge mode, thereby more effectively activating the midbrain dopamine reward system. The excitability of VTA dopamine neurons is regulated by both its own intrinsic and synaptic inputs. Changes in the excitability of VTA dopamine neurons can affect the amount of dopamine released in its projection area, and then mediate the formation and development of drug dependence through changes in the dopamine receptor function of receiving neurons in areas such as the nucleus accumbens and the forebrain cortex. Item Molecular Mechanism The generation of drug dependence-related behaviors depends on abnormal adaptive or plastic changes in neurons in the midbrain dopamine reward pathway, while the development and maintenance of abnormal adaptive changes in neurons depends on changes in intracellular signal transduction systems and nuclear gene expression caused by long-term use of addictive drugs. The important role of the AC/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway in drug dependence is a generally recognized molecular mechanism for the formation and development of drug dependence. end{enumerate} {Section 4 Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of drug dependence} {I. Clinical manifestations} Long-term use of addictive drugs causes serious mental and physical damage to the abuser, and its clinical manifestations include mental disorders, psychological disorders, withdrawal symptoms, poisoning and other related complications. begin{enumerate} item Craving and compulsive drug-taking behavior Craving is an experience of chronic drug abusers after stopping using drugs for a period of time, and is a characteristic manifestation of mental dependence. In order to pursue the mental effects of drugs and avoid the pain of withdrawal symptoms, abusers often disregard laws and morals and use any means to obtain such drugs. Compulsive drug-taking behavior caused by drug dependence is the root cause of social problems such as drug production and trafficking, family destruction, and violent crimes. item Withdrawal syndrome refers to the disturbance of physiological functions caused by the interruption or reduction of drug use after long-term use of addictive drugs. Its severity varies. In severe cases, it can cause serious imbalance of the user's physical and mental homeostasis, damage to organ function or even failure and death. Withdrawal reaction is also an important reason for drug addicts to quit drugs and relapse. Different drugs have different withdrawal symptoms. end{enumerate} (1) Opioids: Symptoms usually appear $6 sim 8$ hours after stopping the drug, and obvious withdrawal symptoms appear 18 to 24 hours later. Clinical manifestations are: (1) Abnormal mental state and behavior, such as anxiety, restlessness, quarrelsomeness, drowsiness or insomnia; (2) Clinical symptoms, such as dyspnea, joint and muscle pain, muscle rigidity, muscle weakness, intention tremor, strabismus, weight loss, chills or fever; (3) Autonomic nervous system symptoms, such as profuse sweating, erect hair, dilated pupils, runny nose, drooling, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal colic, pale skin, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, etc. (2) Marijuana: Sudden discontinuation may cause agitation, loss of appetite, insomnia, decreased body temperature and even chills, fever, and tremors. (3) Psychostimulants: prolonged sleep, general fatigue, mental depression, depression, overeating, etc. Amphetamines have similar symptoms to cocaine. (4) Sedatives, hypnotics, antianxiety drugs and ethanol: The main symptoms are restlessness, anxiety, increased rebound rapid eye movement sleep, insomnia, tremor, deep reflex dysfunction, paroxysmal abnormal EEG (high-amplitude discharge), nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, orthostatic hypotension. In severe cases, high fever, convulsions, delirium, confusion, and terrifying visual and auditory hallucinations may occur. Sudden discontinuation of large doses of barbiturates may cause spasms, convulsions, and even death. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{2} item Mental disorders are the most important and dangerous clinical manifestations. Hallucinations, thinking disorders, personality defects, and even dangerous behaviors such as hurting others or committing suicide may occur. item Poisoning reactions Taking a large amount of addictive drugs at one time or taking them for a long time may cause poisoning reactions. Different drugs cause different symptoms and signs of poisoning reactions. Severe cases may lead to death if not treated in time. end{enumerate} (1) Opioids: Main manifestations: slowed respiratory rate, decreased amplitude, cyanosis; pupil constriction, which may become pinpoint pupils; weak pulse, slow heart rate, decreased blood pressure, cold skin, confusion; peripheral circulatory failure, oliguria or anuria, shock. (2) Marijuana: Clinical manifestations: increased heart rate, postural hypotension, confusion; conjunctival blood vessels congestion and dilation, typical red eyes; associated illusions, hallucinations and thought disorders. Some patients develop severe anxiety, fear and impulsive behavior, accompanied by a sense of impending death. Some may also experience transient depression, pessimism, and suicide. (3) Cocaine: Clinical manifestations: tachycardia, increased blood pressure, dilated pupils, muscle twitching, insomnia, anxiety; hallucinations, paranoid delusions and aggressive behavior may also occur. (4) Amphetamines: Symptoms of poisoning include: polyphagia, headache, confusion, increased blood pressure, dilated pupils, and loss of appetite. Large doses can cause mental confusion and thought disorder. (5) Barbiturates: Long-term use can cause chronic poisoning reactions, mainly manifested as: (1) ataxia; (2) slow comprehension and thinking; (3) emotional instability and irritability; (4) irregular daily life, unruly behavior, and poor moral values; (5) toxic psychosis may occur. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{4} item Damage to the neuropsychiatric system Most drug-dependent patients will have mental abnormalities or disorders such as irritability, anxiety, agitation, paranoia, hallucinations, euphoria, depression, and even mental disorder; the greatest harm is the damage to judgment ability, which leads to violent behavior. Long-term drug abuse has direct toxic effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to irreversible pathological changes in nerve cells or tissues, such as amblyopia, transverse spinal cord lesions, sudden lower limb paraplegia, somatic sensory abnormalities and peripheral neuritis. end{enumerate} {6. Others} (1) Infection: All kinds of addictive drugs can weaken the body's immune function, increasing the susceptibility of drug abusers to various opportunistic infections that are difficult to cure with antibiotics, such as concurrent viral hepatitis, cellulitis, limb necrosis, tetanus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), etc. (2) Effects on the fetus and newborn: Many abused drugs can enter the fetus through the placenta. Therefore, drug abuse during pregnancy can lead to fetal malformation, developmental disorders, miscarriage, premature birth and stillbirth; newborns often have weight loss, susceptibility to infection, organ malformations and physical development disorders. {II. Diagnosis} {(I) Medical history} For patients who actively accept treatment, clinical diagnosis is not difficult; however, for those who are forced to quit drug use, other diagnostic methods such as laboratory tests are often needed. In the process of collecting medical history, special attention should be paid to the time, age, cause and related background of the patient's first drug abuse, the feelings and experience of the first drug abuse; the current mode, route, dosage, frequency, whether it is a combination of drugs, and physical and mental conditions of drug abuse; whether the patient has undergone detoxification after drug abuse. If so, it should be asked when, what method, what drug, where, how effective, why failed, interval between relapses, etc.; whether there are complications and other past medical history, etc. {(II) Diagnostic criteria} begin{enumerate} item Dependence syndrome diagnostic criteria According to the \"CCMD-3 Chinese Classification and Diagnostic Criteria for Mental Disorders\" (3rd edition), it is defined as: repeated use of a certain psychoactive substance leads to a strong physical or psychological craving and tolerance for a certain substance. end{enumerate} (1) Symptom criteria: repeated use of a psychoactive substance with at least two of the following: (1) a strong desire to use a substance; (2) decreased self-control over the start, end, or dosage of substance use; (3) knowing that the substance is harmful but still using it, subjectively hoping to stop or reduce use, but always failing; 4) increased tolerance to the substance; (5) experiencing pleasure when using it or having to use the same substance to eliminate the withdrawal reaction caused by stopping use; (6) withdrawal symptoms after reducing or stopping use; (7) giving up other activities or hobbies due to the use of the substance. (2) Severity criteria: impaired social function. (3) Course criteria: meeting the symptom criteria and severity criteria at some time in the past year. begin{enumerate} setcounter{enumi}{1} item Diagnostic criteria for withdrawal syndrome According to CCMD-3, it is defined as: a syndrome caused by stopping or reducing the use of psychoactive substances, including induced mental symptoms, physical symptoms, or impaired social function. end{enumerate} (1) Symptom criteria: At least three of the following psychiatric symptoms occur due to discontinuation or reduction of the substance used: (1) impaired consciousness; (2) inattention; (3) interoceptive discomfort; (4) hallucinations or illusions; (5) paranoia; (6) memory loss; (7) impaired judgment; (8) mood changes, such as restlessness, anxiety, depression, irritability, and emotional fragility; (9) psychomotor excitement or inhibition; (10) inability to tolerate frustration or setbacks; sleep disorders, such as insomnia; personality changes. At least two of the following physical symptoms or signs occur due to discontinuation or reduction of medication: (1) chills, fever; (2) sweating, tachycardia or bradycardia; (3) hand tremors and heaviness; (4) tearing, runny nose, yawning; (5) pupil dilation or constriction; (6) general pain; (7) nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or increased appetite; (8) abdominal pain, diarrhea; (9) gross tremors or convulsions. (2) Severity criteria: symptoms and severity are related to the substance and dosage used, and symptoms can be relieved by re-use. (3) Course criteria: onset and course are both time-limited. (4) Exclusion criteria (1) Exclude simple sequelae; (2) Other mental disorders (such as anxiety and depressive disorders) can also cause symptoms similar to this syndrome and should be excluded. {(III) Laboratory space inspection} Thin layer chromatography or scanning, spectrophotometry, gas chromatography and other methods are often used to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis on samples of drug addicts. {Section 5 Treatment principles for drug dependence}\n",
      "{I. Principles of drug dependence treatment} Drug dependence treatment includes three basic links: clinical detoxification treatment, subsequent rehabilitation and consolidation, and reintegration into society. This treatment model belongs to the social medical system engineering. Only by closely combining these three links can more drug addicts truly get rid of drug addiction and return to society. In addition, a multi-level drug prevention system should be established throughout the society to make the anti-drug and drug prevention operation mechanism more socialized, standardized, and institutionalized, and gradually form a drug prevention environment for the whole society. It has important clinical and social significance for completely quitting drug addiction and ultimately recovering. begin{enumerate} item Understand the medical history, correct diagnosis, full physical examination and laboratory examination. Determine the treatment plan according to the type and dosage of the drug taken. item Clinical detoxification treatment Clinical detoxification treatment is the first stage and the primary link of the whole course of drug dependence treatment. As the first step to get rid of drugs, there are two treatment goals: first, to help drug addicts change from drug dependence to drug-free state. Second, to help patients maintain drug-free state. Through scientific and reasonable treatment, the withdrawal symptoms caused by drug dependence are reduced to the minimum, and a series of pathological and physiological changes in the body caused by drug dependence and the complications caused by it are effectively treated. Psychological treatment lays the foundation for subsequent rehabilitation consolidation. Commonly used treatment methods in clinical practice include drug reduction therapy for dependence, other drug substitution therapy, integrated Chinese and Western medicine therapy, acupuncture therapy, etc. Item Rehabilitation treatment After the abuser completes clinical detoxification treatment, the patient should be allowed to enter the rehabilitation treatment program as soon as possible and receive a considerable period of physical, psychological and other rehabilitation treatment. The treatment group or treatment community refers to a specific living environment where the residents use the treatment program to solve their personality problems, improve interpersonal relationships, and establish the concept of being responsible for their own behavior. Members should usually live in the community for $6 sim 12$ months. During this period, they need to receive various counseling (such as psychological counseling, vocational counseling, educational counseling, etc.), learn various knowledge, and receive skill training. After completing the basic rehabilitation treatment program in the treatment group, the success rate of drug detoxification is significantly increased, and resocialization is finally achieved. item Relapse prevention and social reintegration Preventing relapse requires a multi-factorial approach to be effective. Drug therapy, rehabilitation therapy, and individual-family-community and social forces should be combined. It requires not only the participation of medical personnel, but also the joint efforts and support of sociologists, psychologists, educators, and legal and law enforcement workers. end{enumerate} {II. Principles of anesthesia for drug-dependent patients} {(I) Pre-anesthetic assessment and preparation} begin{enumerate} item Learn in detail the causes of drug dependence, types of dependent drugs, time and dosage of medication, recent withdrawal symptoms, and previous treatment processes. item Do not perform withdrawal or detoxification treatment for dependent drugs during the perioperative period. item Long-term use of dependent drugs may cause pathological damage to the functions of multiple organs/systems in patients. item Drug-dependent patients may experience withdrawal syndrome during the perioperative period due to discontinuation of dependent drugs. item Patients develop tolerance to analgesics. Therefore, attention should be paid to the dosage of analgesics and antagonists such as naloxone should be used with caution. item Pay attention to the interaction or cross-tolerance between addictive drugs and anesthetic drugs. item Correct malnutrition, dehydration, cachexia, infection, etc. item Pay attention to the patient's mental state and emotional changes. When choosing preoperative sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs, consider that drug-dependent patients may develop tolerance to various sedatives. item Pay attention to the patient's peripheral skin infection and assess the possible difficulty in opening the vein or puncturing the nerve block. item Pay attention to whether the patient has AIDS. end{enumerate} {(II) Selection of anesthesia method and anesthesia management} begin{enumerate} item General anesthesia Drug-dependent patients are generally in poor physical condition and may experience withdrawal symptoms during surgery. It is more appropriate to choose endotracheal intubation and general anesthesia. For opioid-dependent patients, if they are using addictive drugs, opioids such as fentanyl can still be used during surgery, and the dosage should be appropriately increased; for patients in the drug withdrawal period, try not to use opioids. Ketamine is the main analgesic for maintenance, and other general anesthetics, sedatives, and muscle relaxants should be avoided as much as possible to avoid those that have a great impact on heart, liver, and kidney function. It is generally believed that drug-dependent patients have increased tolerance to sedatives and general anesthetics, and the drug effect is reduced, so the dosage should be appropriately increased. item Spinal anesthesia For abdominal and pelvic and lower limb surgeries that are not long, spinal anesthesia can also be carefully performed. However, since drug-dependent patients are prone to spinal infection, they should be carefully examined before surgery, especially paying attention to skin infection at the puncture site and spinal deformity and tenderness. During the operation, they should pay attention to observation and timely detect withdrawal symptoms, and switch to general anesthesia if necessary. item Regional block and nerve block are suitable for simple debridement surgery or wound suture and other minor surgeries. item Anesthesia management Drug-dependent patients may develop tolerance to analgesics and sedatives, and it is difficult to maintain the depth of anesthesia. Monitoring methods such as auditory evoked potentials and bispectral index can be used, combined with strict clinical observation to adjust the dosage of drugs to prevent patients from knowing during the operation. If unexplained heart rate increases, blood pressure increases, secretions increase, etc., you should be highly alert to the possibility of withdrawal symptoms. If the patient is delayed in waking up after surgery, he/she should be sent to PACU or ICU. Antagonists are not recommended. For postoperative analgesia, local anesthetics, chloramine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, etc. can be used. end{enumerate} {References} begin{enumerate} item Zhuang Xinliang, Zeng Yinming, Chen Boluan.
