\section*{Section 3: Routine work of anesthesiologists}
\section*{I. Pre-anesthesia visits and informed consent system}
Unless there are special reasons, the anesthesiologist in charge should follow up the patient before surgery. Through pre-operative visits, understand the patient's general condition, coexisting diseases and severity, and treatment status, and evaluate the treatment results; understand the impact of surgical diseases on the body's physiological state, the type of surgical operation, the expected intraoperative blood loss and (or) fluid transfer, and evaluate the impact of the surgical operation itself on the circulation, respiratory and other systems; explain to the patient the anesthesia method to be selected, the risks and anesthesia complications and accidents that may be caused by anesthesia and monitoring, educate the patient before anesthesia consultation, ask the patient to sign an informed consent form for anesthesia, and record it in the medical record.

For serious preoperative comorbidities that have not been treated or the treatment results are not satisfactory, and these diseases may increase the risk of anesthesia, the surgeon should be communicated with and the surgeon should be consulted. After weighing the urgency of the surgical disease and the risk to the patient, the best time for surgery should be decided and a decision that is more beneficial to the patient should be made. \
For patients who require anesthesia, each patient should read, understand and sign the "Anesthesia Informed Consent" one day before anesthesia. The "Anesthesia Informed Consent" should be signed by the patient himself or the authorized person. Illiterate patients, patients without the ability to sign, and patients under the legal age can entrust their relatives to sign. The "Anesthesia Informed Consent" is valid only after being signed by the patient (or the authorized person) and the anesthesiologist. For patients (or authorized persons) who refuse to sign the "Anesthesia Informed Consent", the anesthesiologist has the right to refuse to give the patient anesthesia; the patient should bear full responsibility for all consequences caused by the failure to perform the operation in time due to the refusal to sign. The "Anesthesia Informed Consent" should be kept together with the patient's medical records. The anesthesiologist provides anesthesia according to the provisions of the "Anesthesia Informed Consent".

When talking with patients and/or their families, residents should learn to pay attention to communication. First, introduce yourself as the anesthesiologist for the patient's surgery. In addition to yourself, there is also a senior anesthesiologist responsible for the anesthesia of this patient. When discussing the disease, you should show that you are very familiar with the patient's condition. When introducing the anesthesia method, risks, complications and accidents, you can make the patient and/or family realize that they must benefit from anesthesia for surgery, and at the same time make them aware of the anesthesia risks they must bear. But let the patient and/or family understand that complications and accidents have a certain probability of occurrence, and not every patient will have them. Let the patient realize that surgery has risks, but it is also relatively safe. For patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade II or above or critically ill patients, the family members must sign the "Anesthesia Informed Consent Form", fully explain the anesthesia risks, and explain that the anesthesiologist will make every effort to prevent and deal with anesthesia risks as much as possible. Anesthesiologists should know what must be said (such as risk notification), what should be said (such as we will do our best) and what cannot be said (such as exaggerating the danger, devaluing surgeons, etc.) when talking to patients and/or their families before anesthesia.

\section*{II. Surgical Safety Verification System ("Three-party Verification")}
egin{enumerate}
\item Surgical safety verification is jointly performed by qualified surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating room nurses. The patient's identity and surgical site are verified before anesthesia is performed, before the operation begins, and before the patient leaves the operating room. All surgical patients should wear a label with patient identification information for verification. The surgeon, anesthesiologist and operating room nurse fill in the "Surgical Safety Verification Form" item by item and confirm it together. For operations without the participation of anesthesiologists, the surgeon and operating room nurse fill in the corresponding content.

\item Content and process of implementing surgical safety check

\end{enumerate}

(1) Before anesthesia is implemented: the parties to the check confirm the contents of the first item of the "Surgical Safety Checklist" before anesthesia in turn: patient identity (name, gender, age and medical record number), surgical method, informed consent, surgical site and identification, whether the safety inspection of anesthesia equipment is completed, implants, prostheses, patient allergy history, antimicrobial skin test results, infectious disease examination results, preoperative blood preparation, skin integrity, surgical field skin preparation, intravenous access establishment, imaging data, etc.

(2) Before the start of surgery: the parties to the check jointly check the contents of the second item of the "Surgical Safety Checklist" before the start of surgery: patient identity (name, gender and age), surgical method, surgical site, surgical position, surgical and anesthesia risk warning (estimated operation time, expected blood loss, surgical focus, anesthesia focus, whether the sterilization of items is qualified, etc.), and whether antibiotics were given 30 minutes before skin incision, etc.

(3) Before the patient leaves the operating room: All parties involved in the verification jointly verify the contents of the third item of the "Surgical Safety Checklist" before the patient leaves the operating room: patient identity (name, gender and age), actual surgical method, surgical medication and blood transfusion, inventory of surgical supplies, confirmation of surgical specimens, inspection of skin integrity, arteriovenous access, drainage tube, urinary catheter, postoperative analgesia pump, confirmation of patient's destination, etc.

(4) All parties involved in the verification fill in the relevant verification items and sign the "Surgical Safety Checklist", which will be kept in the medical record.
